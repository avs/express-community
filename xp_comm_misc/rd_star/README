Express Community "ReadStar" Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------

This special Community project contains a reader for the Star-CD data format.
Star-CD is a CFD package created by Computational Dynamics Ltd.  The
code included is meant to provide a reader for the data files produced
by this package.  Unfortunately the Community have been unable to get this
code working properly on our test platforms.  However it is possible
that the code may work or can be modified to work properly on
different platforms.  Therefore the Community have released this project
so that users will have the code available.  Unfortunately the Community will
not be able to provide any support in the use of this project.

It should also be noted that the data format read has become outdated
and that the reader cannot read files from the current version of
Star-CD.

The supplied distribution contains a complete project directory structure.
It should be extracted into a new directory and AVS/Express should be used
to compile the supplied Fortran source files.

Further instructions can be found in the 'README.TXT' and 'src/readme' files.
