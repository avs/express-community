Express Community "InterSense" Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------------

This special Community project contains an interface from AVS/Express to the
InterSense range of motion tracking devices.  The Community does not have
access to any of this hardware and hence we have not been able to test
this project.  The project is provided so that users with InterSense
hardware can make use of it.  Unfortunately the Community will not be able to
provide any support in the use of this project as we will not be able
to investigate or solve any problems.

The supplied distribution contains a complete project directory structure.
It should be extracted into a new directory and AVS/Express should be used
to compile the supplied C++ source files.

Further instructions can be found in the 'readme.txt' file.
