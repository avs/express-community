Express Community "ReadPhoenics" Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------------

This special Community project contains a reader for the Phoenics data format.
Phoenics is a CFD package created by CHAM Ltd. The code included is
meant to provide a reader for the data files produced by this package.
Unfortunately the Community have been unable to get this code working properly
on our test platforms. However it is possible that the code may work or
can be modified to work properly on different platforms. Therefore the
Community have released this project so that users will have the code
available. Unfortunately the Community will not be able to provide any support
in the use of this project.

It should also be noted that the data format read has become outdated
and that the reader cannot read files from the current version of
Phoenics.

The supplied distribution contains a complete project directory structure.
It should be extracted into a new directory and AVS/Express should be used
to compile the supplied Fortran source files.
