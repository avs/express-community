Express Community "VolumePro" Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This special Community project contains an interface from AVS/Express to the
VolumePro range of volume rendering hardware.  The Community does not have
access to any of this hardware and hence we have not been able to test
this project.  The project is provided so that users with VolumePro
hardware can make use of it.  Unfortunately the Community will not be able to
provide any support in the use of this project as we will not be able
to investigate or solve any problems.

The supplied distribution contains a complete project directory structure.
It should be extracted into a new directory and AVS/Express should be used
to compile the supplied C++ source files.

The core Volume Rendering code is contained within the 'vliren.cxx' file.
Two versions of this code have been provided.  The first version is that
contained within the original 'vliren.cxx' file and the 'vliren.cxx.ORIG'
file.

The second version has been provided by KGT Inc.  It alters the original
version so that it renders directly to OpenGL.  Various improvements to
the lighting model have also been made.  Unfortunately in the process
some values have been hardwired.  The altered version is contained in
the file 'vliren.cxx.KGT'.  #ifdef statements have been used to identify
the alterations from the original version.

Further instructions can be found in the 'ReadMeBuildWindowsNT' file.
