Express Community CombineData Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/combdata/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"CombineData".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new CombineData project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the CombineData project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.CombineData.CombineDataMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/a_alias/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

combdata.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.CombineData library.

cmbdmods.v	Creates the CombineDataMods library containing the low-level
		modules DVcombine_data_to_HSV, DVcombine_data_to_RGB, DVadd_node_data
		and CMBD_extract_data_array, and the parameter group CombineDataParams.

cmbdmacs.v	Creates the CombineDataMacs library containing the UI component
		CMBD_ComponentBox, the User Interface macros Combine_Datasets_To_HSV_UI
		and Combine_Datasets_To_RGB_UI, the functional macros
		Combine_Datasets_To_HSV_Func and Combine_Datasets_To_RGB_Func,
		the user macros Combine_Datasets_To_HSV and Combine_Datasets_To_RGB
		and the example application CombineDataEg.

comb_hsv.cxx	The C++ source code for the DVcombine_data_to_HSV module.

comb_rgb.cxx	The C++ source code for the DVcombine_data_to_RGB module.

add_nd_d.cxx	The C++ source code for the DVadd_node_data module.

combdata.html	HTML documentation for the user macros and associated modules.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

comb_hsv.o/obj	Intermediate object file.

comb_rgb.o/obj	Intermediate object file.

add_nd_d.o/obj	Intermediate object file.
