Express Community Scalar2Texture2 Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/scl2tex2/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Scalar2Texture2".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Scalar2Texture2 project, and additions to one or more of files in the 
xp_comm_lib/ directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library
page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.Scalar2Texture2.Scalar2Texture2Mods in the Templates library,
and then perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command
into the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following 
command to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Scalar2Texture2.Scalar2Texture2Mods

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/scl2tex2/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

scl2tex.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Scalar2Texture2 library.

s2tx2mod.v	Creates the Scalar2Texture2Mods library containing the low-level
		module Scalar2Texture2Core.
		
s2tx2mac.v	Creates the Scalar2Texture2Macs library containing the user macro
		Scalar2Texture.

s2tx2app.v	Creates the Scalar2Texture2Apps library containing the example
		applications Scalar2TextureEg, s2tComparisonEg and Datamap2TextureEg.

scl2tex2.cxx	The C++ source code for the Scalar2Texture2Core module.

doc_umac.html	HTML documentation for the Scalar2Texture User Macro.

scl2tex.html	Original macro documentation.

README		This file.

rainbow.jpg	Example texture map image.

compare.jpg	Image showing comparison between colormaps and texture-maps.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h	AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx	AVS/Express generated source code.

scl2tex2.o	Intermediate object file.


Prerequisites
-------------

The s2tComparisonEg example application relies on the successful installation
of the following components.  Without them it will not function correctly.

Common Project


The Datamap2TextureEg example application relies on the successful installation
of the following components.  Without them it will not function correctly.

Dmap2Image Project


All the other macros in this project do not have any prerequisites.
