Express Community FastAdvector Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/f_advect/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"FastAdvector".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new FastAdvector project, and additions to 2 of the files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

The project contains only V code and no modules within the project contain
procedural code.  Hence the project does not have to be compiled.  The project
makes use of low-level AVS/Express modules and hence requires the Developer's
Edition of AVS/Express.
