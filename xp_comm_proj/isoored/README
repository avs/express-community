Express Community Isosurface Object Reduction Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/isoored/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community modules
"IsoObjsReduce" and "IsoObjsReduce2".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new IsoObjsReduce project, and a single line addition to an xp_comm_lib/
file (in this instance mappers.v) to add a link to the User
Macro from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of
the new project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process
unspecified, it will by default use the "express" process. Doing so
means the module may be compiled by using one of the following
commands in the top-level directory of your project (whilst
AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file
already exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the IsoObjsReduce project, and neglect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may
be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.IsoObjsReduce.IsoObjsReduceMods
	
	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project
menu.
