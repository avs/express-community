Express Community Threshold Example Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/overlay/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the project
"OverlayImages".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Threshold project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance filters.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.Overlay.OverlayMods in the Templates library, and then
perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command into
the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following command
to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Overlay.OverlayMods

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/thresh/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v and examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this
               file.

overlay.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Overlay library.

overmods.v     Creates the OverlayMods library containing the low-level
               module OverlayNodeData and the parameter group
               OverlayParams.

overmacs.v     Creates the OverlayMacs library containing the high-level
               macros OverlayUI, OverlayImages, overlayImages and the
               example application OverlayEg.

will regenerate these files.

gen.h          AVS/Express generated header file.
