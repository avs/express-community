Express Community Ellipse Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/ellipse/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community
Example project "Ellipse".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Ellipse project, and additions to two of the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this
instance misc.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User Macro from the
top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Ellipse.EllipseMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/ellipse/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v,
               xp_comm_lib/misc.v and xp_comm_lib/examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use
               this file.

ellipse.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Ellipse library.

ell_mods.v     Creates the EllipseMods library containing the low-level module
               EllipseCore and the parameter block EllipseParams.

ell_macs.v     Creates the library containing the Functional macro Ellipse, the
               UI macro EllipseUI, the User macro ellipse and the example
               application EllipseEg.

ellipse.cxx    The C++ source code for the EllipseCore low-level module.

disclaimer     Community terms of use.

doc_mod.html   HTML documentation for the low-level module.

doc_umac.html  HTML documentation for the User Macro.

README         This file.


Prerequisites
-------------

The Functional and UI macros of this project rely on the successful
installation of the following components. Without them they will
not function correctly.

Common Project



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h                AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx              AVS/Express generated source code.

ellipse.o/obj        Intermediate object file.
