Express Community BoundsLite Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/boundslt/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project BoundsLite.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new BoundsLite project, and a single line addition to an xp_comm_lib/
file (in this instance misc.v) to add a link to the User
Macro from the new top-level Community library page.
