Express Community TextureWave Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/twave/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"TextureWave".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new TextureWave project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the TextureWave project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.TextureWave.TextureWaveMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/twave/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

twave.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.TextureWave template library.

tw_mods.v	Creates the TextureWaveMods library containing the low-level
		module TextureWaveCore and the parameter block TextureWaveParams.

tw_macs.v	Creates the TextureWaveMacs library containing the user interface
		macro TextureWaveUI, the functional macro TextureWaveFunc and the
		user macros texture_wave and texture_wave_field.

tw_apps.v	Creates the TextureWaveMacs library containing the example
		applications TextureWaveEg1, TextureWaveEg2, TextureWaveEg3 and
		TextureWaveEg4.

twave.cxx	The C++ source code for the TextureWaveCore module.

twave.html	HTML documentation for the texture_wave macro, and modules.

twavefld.html	HTML documentation for the texture_wave_field macro.

twave.tif       Sample image files used as texture sources
twave2.tif

Prerequisites
-------------

The texture_wave_field user macro and associated example applications rely on
the successful installation of the following component.  Without it they will
not function correctly.  All the other macros in this project do not have any
prerequisites.

Scalar2Texture Project


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

twave.o/obj	Intermediate object file.
