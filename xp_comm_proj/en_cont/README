Express Community EnhanceContrast Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/en_cont/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"EnhanceContrast".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and three additions to the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance
filters.v and examples.v) to add links to the User Macro, Base Function and
Example application from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.EnhanceContrast.EnhanceContrastMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/en_cont/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v and examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use
               this file.

en_cont.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.EnhanceContrast library.

enc_mods.v     Creates the EnhanceContrastMods library containing the low-level
               EnhanceContrastCore module and the EnhanceContrastParams parameter block.

enc_macs.v     Creates the EnhanceContrastMacs library containing the user interface 
               macro IPEnhanceContrastUI, the functional macro IPEnhanceContrastFunc, the 
               high-level user macro IPEnhanceContrast and the base function
               ip_enhance_contrast.

enc_apps.v     Creates the EnhanceContrastApps library containing the example 
               application EnhanceContrastEg.

completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx         AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx         AVS/Express generated source code.

en_cont.o/obj   Intermediate object files.
clahe.o/obj
