Express Community ConeCrop Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/conecrop/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ConeCrop".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/ directory
to add links to the User Macro and Example Applications to the top-level
Community library page.
