Express Community Read HDF Image Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/r_hdfimg/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community Read HDF Image
project "ReadHDFImage".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new ReadHDFImage project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance data_io.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Prerequisites
-------------

The project uses the SDSC image tool libraries, which are linked to when the
project is compiled. The SDSC image tool library can be downloaded from
ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/sdsc/graphics/imtools. In there you will find the source
code archive, along with information about other required libraries, such as
the TIFF and JPEG libraries.

The TIFF library is obtainable from ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff, and the JPEG
library is obtainable from ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg, if you do not already
have these installed on your system.

Note: By default, the V code for the module, assumes that it will find the
"im.h" include file in /usr/local/include (the default installation area
for the above libraries; PC users will have a different default), and 
similarly that it will find the libraries libim, libsdsc, libtiff and libjpeg
in /usr/local/lib. Change the module properties 'hdr_dirs' and 'link_files'
to point to the appropriate place. Additionally, on some systems, the SDSC
library may already contain the TIFF and JPEG libraries, so the -ltiff and
-ljpeg parts of the 'link_files' property may not be required.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadHDFImage.ReadHDFImageMods in the Templates library, and
then perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command into
the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following command
to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadHDFImage.ReadHDFImageMods

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/r_hdfimg/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ data_io.v and examples.v files. This file should
		not be edited as the future installation script will use this
		file.

r_hdfimg.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadHDFImage library.

rhi_mods.v	Creates the ReadHDFImageMods library containing the low-level
		module ReadHDFImageField and the parameter group
		ReadHDFImageParams.

rhi_macs.v	Creates the ReadHDFImageMacs library containing the high-level
		macros ReadHDFImageUI, ReadHDFImage, read_hdf_image and the
		example appplication ReadHDFImageEg.

r_hdfimg.c	The C source code for the ReadHDFImageField module.

doc_mod.html	HTML documentation for the ReadHDFImageField module.

doc_umac.html	HTML documentation for the read_hdf_image User Macro.

README		This file.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

r_hdfimg.o	Intermediate object file.
