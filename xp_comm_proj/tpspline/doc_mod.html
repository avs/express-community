<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
The TPS_unif_core and TPS_rect_core modules use the Thin Plate Spline algorithm
to generate uniform and rectilinear output grids from a set of points and values.
The interpolation calculated by the Thin Plate Spline algorithm passes exactly
through all the input points.  However the output grid only respects the input
points in the case of a rectilinear grid with a 'smoothness' of 0.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The output grid is represented as a number of arrays of data.  These can be input
into the appropriate field mapper to generate uniform or rectilinear fields.  This
is done in the Functional macros TPS_unif and TPS_rect.  In most cases it will be
easier to use these macros than it will be to use these modules directly.
</blockquote>


<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>coord[..][2]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Coordinates of the points that are to be used to generate the resulting grid.  This
float array should consist of a series of x,y coordinate pairs.  It is not possible
to use 3D coordinates.  If a rectilinear grid is being generated and the smoothness
is set to zero then output points will be present at all of these coordinates.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>values[..]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Value of the input variable at the input coordinates.  This float array should match
the coordinate input array. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>&amp;TPS_Params</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the parameter block, which contains real instances of the smoothness
and dimensioning variables. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>smooth</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the 'smoothness' variable of type float, via the parameter block, which
is referenced by the &amp;TPS_Params input.  The smoothness value specifies now smooth
the resultant surface should be.  If the smoothness is set to zero then in a rectilinear
grid output points will be present at all of the input points.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>dims[2]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the dims array of type int, via the parameter block, which is
referenced by the &amp;TPS_Params input.  This parameter is used by the
TPS_unif_core module and specifies the x and y dimensions that the resultant
uniform grid should have.  It is not used by the TPS_rect_core module.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>add_points</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the add_points variable of type int, via the parameter block, which is
referenced by the &amp;TPS_Params input.  This parameter is used by the
TPS_rect_core module and specifies how many points should be added in between each
of the input points.  Increasing this value will improve the accuracy of the resultant
mesh.  It is not used by the TPS_unif_core module.
</blockquote>


<h3>Outputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>dims[2]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Dimensions of output rectilinear grid.  This output is not used by the TPS_unif_core
module.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>points[...][2]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Location of output grid in space.  The TPS_unif_core outputs the coordinates
of the extreme points of the uniform grid.  The TPS_rect_core outputs the
coordinates of the origin of each grid line in the rectilinear mesh.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>out[]</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Values of each node on the output grid.  The values are calculated by using
the Thin Plate Spline algorithm to interpolate between each input point.
</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level TPS_unif_core module is used in the Functional Macro TPS_unif
and the User Macro tps_unif. The low-level TPS_rect_core module is used in the
Functional Macro TPS_rect and the User Macro tps_rect. Additionally, these
macros also use the TPS_Params parameter block group, as do the UI macros.
</blockquote>


<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
Two example applications are provided, TPS_uniform_Eg and TPS_rectilinear_Eg which
generate uniform and rectilinear grids from a set of points.  In both cases the
grid is then converted into a field and expanded into 3 dimensions by using the surf_plot
module.  This is done to make the effect of the Thin Plate Spline easier to see.
</blockquote>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<I>xp_comm_proj/tpspline/tps_mods.v</I> contains the V definitions of the TPS_Params
group and the TPS_unif_core and TPS_rect_core modules.
</blockquote>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level ThinPlateSplineMods library containing the modules
TPS_unif_core and TPS_rect_core, does not specify a process. By default
the express process will be used.

<blockquote>
The Thin Plate Spline implementation is based upon the code written by
