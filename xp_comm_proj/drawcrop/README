Express Community DrawCrop Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/drawcrop/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project "DrawCrop".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new DrawCrop project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance filters.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.DrawCrop.DrawCrop in the Templates library, and then
perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command into
the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following command
to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$base -comp_proc express -exit




Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/thresh/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v and examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this
               file.

drawcrop.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.DrawCrop library.

cropmods.v     Creates the DrawCropMods library containing the low-level
               modules nescessary for this application, these are 
               crop_controls, crop_mouse, crop_coordinate and cropdata.

cropmacs.v     Creates the DrawCropMacs library containing the high-level
               macros UI_acr_nema, Read_acr_nema and the example
               appplication  DrawCrop_Eg.

crop_sa.v      Creates the DrawCropStandAlone library containing the macros 
               that can be used for a stand alone application. These include
               a different ContinuousSketch module a macro called SA_CD_macro
               (stands for "StandAlone_CropDraw_Macro") as well as an example
               application called StandAloneDrawCrop_Eg. These modules can
               only be used with the Developers Edition of AVS/Express and so
               are only availiable form the Templates library.

cropcont       Is the directory that holds the C source code cropcont.c for 
               the crop_controls module used as a part of the DrawCrop user 
               macro.

cordcrop       Is the directory that holds the C source code corcrop1.c, 
               corcrop2.c, corcrop3.c, corcrop4.c and corcrop5.c for 
               the crop_coordinate module used as a part of the DrawCrop user 
               macro.

cropdata       Is the directory that holds the C source code cropdat1.c, 
               cropdat2.c, cropdat3.c, cropdat4.c and cropdat5.c for 
               the cropdata module  used as a part of the DrawCrop user 
               macro.

cropmous       Is the directory that holds the C source code cropmou1.c, 
               cropmou2.c, cropmou3.c, cropmou4.c and cropmou5.c for the
               crop_mouse module which is not used as a part of the DrawCrop 
               user macro but would be used in a stand alone application.

mod_docs       Is a directory that holds the HTML documentation for the 
               DrawCrop modules including cont_mod.html, cdat_mod.html, 
               coordmod.html and mousemod.html.

mac_docs       Is a directory that holds the HTML documentation for the 
               DrawCrop User Macro and SA_DC_macro the macro suitable for a
               stand-alone application.
