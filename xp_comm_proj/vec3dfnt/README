Express Community Vector3dFonts Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/vec3dfnt/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project 
"Vector3dFonts".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Vector3dFonts project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance misc.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled.If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Vector3dFonts project, and elect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may
be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Vector3dFonts.Vector3dFontsMods
	
	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project
menu.
