Express Community Reducer Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/reducer/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project Reducer.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Reducer project, and a single line addition to an xp_comm_lib/
file (in this instance misc.v) to add a link to the User
Macro from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of
the new project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process
unspecified, it will by default use the "express" process. Doing so
means the module may be compiled by using one of the following
commands in the top-level directory of your project (whilst
AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file
already exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Reducer project, and elect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may
be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Reducer.ReducerMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project
menu.


Files

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/reducer/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/misc.v file. This file should not be edited as the
			   future installation script will use this file.

reducer.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Reducer library.

red_mods.v     Creates the ReducerMods library containing the low-level module
			   ReducerCore and the parameter block ReducerParams.

red_macs.v     Creates the ReducerMacs library containing the high-level 
               functional macro ReducerFunc, user interface macro ReducerUI
			   and the user macro Reducer.

red_apps.v     Creates the ReducerApps library containing the example
               application ReducerEg.  
			   
reducer.cxx    The C++ source code for the ReducerCore module.

reducer.html   HTML documentation for the Reducer module.

README         This file.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h           AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx         AVS/Express generated C++ source file.

reducer.o       Intermediate object file.
