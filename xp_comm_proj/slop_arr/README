Express Community slice_orthoplane_ARR Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/slop_arr/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"slice_orthoplane_ARR".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new slice_orthoplane_ARR project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

No modules within the project contain procedural code so the project does not
have to be compiled.
