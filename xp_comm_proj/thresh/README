Express Community Threshold Example Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/thresh/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community Threshold
Example project "Threshold".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Threshold project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance filters.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.Threshold.ThresholdMods in the Templates library, and then
perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command into
the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following command
to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Threshold.ThresholdMods
