Express Community RegionGrow Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/reg_grow/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project 
"RegionGrow".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new RegionGrow project, and three single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance filters.v, mappers.v and examples.v) to add a link to
the User Macros and the Example Applications from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the RegionGrow project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.RegionGrow.RegionGrow

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/thresh/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v, mappers.v and examples.v files. This
               file should not be edited as the future installation script
               will use this file.

reg_grow.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.RegionGrow library.

rg_mods.v      Creates the RegionGrowMods library containing the low-level
               modules nescessary for this application. These are 
               RegionGrowCore, GenerateGuassianProbs and AccumulateCore. The
               library also contains the RegionGrowParams parameter block.

rg_macs.v      Creates the RegionGrowMacs library containing the user interface
               macros RegionGrowUI and AccumulateUI, the functional macros
               RegionGrow and Accumulate, the user macros region_grow and
               accumulate_regions, and the example appplications RegionGrowEg and  
               AccumulateRegionEg.

reg_grow.c     C source code for the low-level RegionGrowCore module.

genguas.c      C source code for the low-level GenerateGuassianProbs module.

rg_accum.c     C source code files for the low-level AccumulateCore module.
rg_acc_d.c

doc_reg.html   HTML documentation for the RegionGrowCore module. 

doc_gau.html   HTML documentation for the GenerateGuassianProbs module.

doc_acc.html   HTML documentation for the AccumulateCore module.

README         This file.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h           AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.c           AVS/Express generated source code.

reg_grow.o/obj  Intermediate object files.
rg_accum.o/obj
rg_acc_d.o/obj
