Express Community StringArraySubset Module
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/strarsub/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community StringArraySubset
module.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new StringArraySubset project, and a single line addition to an xp_comm_lib/
file (in this instance misc.v) to add a link to the User
Macro from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of
the new project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process
unspecified, it will by default use the "express" process. Doing so
means the module may be compiled by using one of the following
commands in the top-level directory of your project (whilst
AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file
already exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the StringArraySubset project, and elect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may
be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.StrArrSub.StrArrSubMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project
menu.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/misc.v file. This file should not be edited as the
			   future installation script will use this file.

strarsub.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.StrArrSub library.

sas_mods.v     Creates the StrArrSubMods library containing the low-level
               module string_array_subset.

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

sas_gen.h       AVS/Express generated header file.

sas_gen.cxx     AVS/Express generated C++ source file.

strarsub.o      Intermediate object file.
