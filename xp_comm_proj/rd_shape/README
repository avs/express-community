Express Community ReadShape Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/rd_shape/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ReadShape".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and two additions to two of the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance
data_io.v and example.v) to add links to the User Macro, Module library and
the Example Applications from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadShape.ReadShapeMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/rd_shape/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v,
               xp_comm_lib.data_io.v and xp_comm_lib/examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this file.

rd_shape.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadShape library.

rshpmods.v     Creates the ReadShapeMods library containing the low-level
               modules ReadShapeHeader, ReadShapePoint, ReadShapeArc, ReadShapePolygon
               and ReadShapePolygonAsLine.

rshpmacs.v     Creates the ReadShapeMacs library containing the functional macros;
               PointShape, ArcShape, PolygonShape and PolygonAsLineShape.  The
               library also contains the read_shape user macro and associated macros.

rshpapps.v     Creates the ReadShapeApps library containing the example applications 
               ReadShapeUserEg and ReadShapeProgramEg.

               C++ source code for the low-level modules.  This provides the interface
               between AVS/Express and the Shape file reading code.

Prerequisites
-------------

Reading the full Shape file format also relies on the successful installation
of the ReadDbase project.  If this project is not installed data contained in
DBF files will not be read.  The ReadShapeProgramEg example application shows
how components of the ReadDbase project can be used.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

hdr_gen.h             AVS/Express generated header files.
pnt_gen.h
arc_gen.h
plg_gen.h
pgl_gen.h

hdr_gen.cxx           AVS/Express generated source code files.
