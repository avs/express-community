Express Community Crop3D Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/crop3d/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project "Crop3D".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and two additions to the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance
filters.v and examples.v) to add links to the User Macro and Example
application from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Crop3D.Crop3DMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

               this file.

crop3d.v       Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Crop3D library.

crp3dmod.v     Creates the Crop3DMods library containing the low-level 
               Crop3DCore module and the Crop3DParams parameter block.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h           AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx         AVS/Express generated C++ source file.

*.o             Intermediate object files.
