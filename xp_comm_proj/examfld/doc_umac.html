<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Examines arrays within an AVS/Express field, and writes information about the arrays into a string object which is connected to ui objects.
</p>
<p>
A summary of the number of arrays is produced, and has the form :
</p>
<p>
<code>
n arrays
<br>
(n1 gr, n2 nd, n3 cd, n4 co)
</code>
</p>
<p>
where <code>n</code> is the total number of arrays in the field, <code>n1</code> the number of grid arrays (may be 1 or 0 if the grid is a connection to a function), <code>n2</code> is the number of node data arrays, <code>n3</code> is the number of cell data arrays and <code>n4</code> is the number of connectivity arrays. 
</p>
<p>
A connectivity array is defined as being the poly_connect_list in a Cell_Set, if it exists, otherwise it is the node_connect_list.
</p>
<p>
Next, information about each array is written in the form :
</p>
<code>
no - name
<br>
type [length], size
</code>
</p>
<p>
where, <code>no</code> is the array's number (see next paragraph), <code>name</code> is as given in its label subobject (or `?' if unset), <code>type</code> is the data type, <code>length</code> is the number of entries in the array, and <code>size</code> is the size of the array (in bytes if less than 1kb big, else in kb).
</p>
<p>
Arrays are numbered starting from 1, and in the following order : grid, node data, cell data and connectivity. Ordering of arrays within each of these categories is as in the input field.
</p>
<p>
Example output is :
</p>
<p>
<code>
2 arrays
<br>
(1 gr, 1 nd, 0 cd, 0 co).
<br>

<br>
1 -  ?
<br>
float [122880], 480kb
<br>

<br>
2 -  density
<br>
float [40960], 160kb
</code>
</p>

<p>
The macro also includes a ui macro which uses a UImod_panel to provide a window into which the string is output. A UImod_panel automatically adds widgets to a SingleWindowApp, MultiWindowApp, or ModuleStack, and in this manner the string is written to a suitable window for the application that is running.
</p>

<h3>Input Ports</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>& data</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
A reference to the input data, which must be in the form of certain field sub-objects. The following objects must be present in the group : int <i>nnodes</i>, int <i>nspace</i>, Data_Array <i>coordinates</i>. All the other sub-objects of a field are optional. Thus, any valid field or sub-set of a field (e.g. Mesh+Node_Data) will be accepted.
</blockquote>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>text_string</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Object to which information about the field is written. This object is connected to a UItext object in the <i>Examine_Field</i> macro, and this in turn is connected to the UImod_panel within the same macro so that it appears in an application window.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>text_rows</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Number of lines in the <i>text_string</i>.
</blockquote>

<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
The user macro <i>examine_field</i> combines the functional macro <i>Examine_Field</i> with the ui macro <i>Examine_Field_UI</i>, via the use of the common parameter block <i>Examine_Field_Param</i>, to provide a usable macro in the visualization library.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
An example application <i>Examine_Field_Eg</i> is provided, which uses the AVS/Express sample data file <i>bluntfin.fld</i>. This data file contains six arrays (one grid plus five node data). Information about the arrays is shown in a SingleWindowApp main window by selecting the examine_field option from the editors, modules menu.
</blockquote>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>xp_comm_proj/examfld/efldmacs.v </i>
<br>
contains the V definitions for the functional macro <i>Examine_Field</i>, the user macro <i>examine_field</i>, the ui macro <i>Examine_Field_UI</i> and the example application <i>Examine_Field_Eg</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>xp_comm_proj/examfld/efldmods.v</i>
<br>
contains the V definitions for the <i>Examine_Field_Param</i> group and the <i>Examine_Field_Prim</i> module.
</p>
<p>
<i>xp_comm_proj/examfld/examfld.cxx</i>
<br>
contains the source code for the primitive module.
</p>
<p>
<i>xp_comm_proj/examfld/INSTALL</i>
<br>
contains instructions on how to add Examine_Field project modules and macros to the IAC library structure.
</p>
<p>
<i>xp_comm_proj/examfld/README</i>
<br>
contains instructions on how to compile and install Examine_Field project modules and macros.
</p>
<p>
Additional files are required for AVS/Express utility functions (see below).
</p>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
The module also requires the <i>xp_util</i> AVS/Express utility code files. These may be obtained from <a href="http://www.iavsc.org">http://www.iavsc.org/</a>, and need to be installed in the <i>xp_comm_proj</i> directory according to the instructions given with the package.
</p>
<p>
If both the Examine_Field project and the Compress project are required, then the <code>cxx_src_files</code> line in either the <i>efldmods.v</i> file or the <i>compmods.v</i> file should be removed or commented out (these cxx_src_files are common to both projects, which causes errors/warnings when linking if they are specified twice). 
</p>
<p>
See the <i>README</i> and <i>INSTALL</i> files for full information about compiling and installing the Examine_Field project modules and macros.
