Examine_Field Project
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/examfld/ ) contains all the V code, source 
code, HTML documentation, and installation information for an AVS/Express 
field examination tool "Examine_Field".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Examine_Field project, and two single line additions to some of the 
xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance misc.v and examples.v) to add a link to the 
User Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

It should be noted that the utils_xp Community utility library project is a
pre-requisite. See the doc_mod.html and doc_umac.html files for full details.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the Examine_Field project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or a user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Examine_Field.Examine_FieldMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

If both the Examine_Field project and the Compress project are required, then
the cxx_src_files line in either the examine_field_mods.v file or the
compress_mods.v file should be removed or commented out (these cxx_src_files
are common to both projects, which causes errors/warnings when linking if
they are specified twice).

			installation script will use this file.

examfld.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Examine_Field library.

efldmods.v		Creates the Examine_FieldMods library containing the 
			low-level module Examine_Field_Prim and the parameter
			group Examine_Field_Param.

efldmacs.v		Creates the Examine_FieldMacs library containing the 
			high-level macros Examine_Field_UI, Examine_Field,
			examine_field and the example appplication

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.
