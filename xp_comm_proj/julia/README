Express Community Julia Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/julia/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Julia".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Julia project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Julia project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Julia.JuliaMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/mandel/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

julia.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Julia library.

jul_mods.v	Creates the JuliaMods library containing the low-level
		modules JuliaGen, and the parameter group JuliaParams.

jul_macs.v	Creates the JuliaMacs library containing the high-level
		macros JuliaUI, julia, and the example application
		JuliaEg.

julia.cxx	The C++ source code for the JuliaGen module.

doc_mod.html	HTML documentation for the JuliaGen module.

doc_umac.html	HTML documentation for the Julia User Macro.

README		This file.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.c		AVS/Express generated source code.

julia.o		Intermediate object file.
