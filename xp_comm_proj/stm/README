Express Community special porject - See The Molecule (STM)
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/stm/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community special project
See The Molecule (STM).

This project is classified as a special project by the Community. Therefore we cannot offer the same level of support for this project as we do for other projects.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and a single line addition to one of the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this
instance misc.v) to add a link to the STM Library from the new top-level
Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit

or      make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.
