<h1>STM: See The Molecule</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
The STM codes are a suite of application codes and AVS modules to display both geometric structure and electronic properties. Electronic and geometrical structural information is obtained from either Density Functional Theory (DFT)
or Schr&ouml;dinger Theory, using a variety of computational or experimental approaches.

<p> 
This project is classified as a special project by the IAC. Therefore we cannot offer the same level of support for this project as we do for other projects.
