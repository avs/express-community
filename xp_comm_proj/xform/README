Express Community Xform Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/xform/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Xform".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Xform project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the modules may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Xform project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Xform.XformMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/xform/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

xform.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadDted library.

xfrmmods.v	Creates the XformMods library containing the low-level
		modules cartesian_to_spherical, spherical_to_cartesian,
		cartesian_to_cylindrical and cylindrical_to_cartesian.

xfrmmacs.v	Creates the XformMacs library containing the functional macros
		cart2sph, sph2cart, cart2cyl and cyl2cart, and the example
		applications CylindricalCoordsEg and SphericalCoordsEg.

cart2sph.cxx	C++ source code for the cartesian_to_spherical module.

sph2cart.cxx	C++ source code for the spherical_to_cartesian module.

cart2cyl.cxx	C++ source code for the cartesian_to_cylindrical module.

cyl2cart.cxx	C++ source code for the cylindrical_to_cartesian module.

xform.html	HTML documentation for the user macros and associated modules.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

cart2sph.o/obj	Intermediate object files.
sph2cart.o/obj
cart2cyl.o/obj
cyl2cart.o/obj
