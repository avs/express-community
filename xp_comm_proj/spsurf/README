Express Community SphereSurface Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/spsurf/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"SphereSurface".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new SphereSurface project, and additions to one or more of files in the
xp_comm_lib/ directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library
page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the SphereSurface project, and elect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be
compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following
command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.SphereSurface.SphereSurfaceMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/spsurf/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v

		future installation script will use this file.

spsurf.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.SphereSurface library.

spsfmods.v	Creates the SphereSurfaceMods library containing the low-level
		modules SphereSurfaceGen, and the parameter group
		SphereSurfaceParams.

spsfmacs.v	Creates the SphereSurfaceMacs library containing the high-level
		macros SphereSurfaceUI, SphereSurface, sphere_surface,
		sphere_surface_data and sphere_surface_lite.

spsfapps.v	Creates the SphereSurfaceMacs library containing the example
		applications SphereSurfaceEg1 and SphereSurfaceEg2.

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.
