Express Community Read6DOF Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/rd_6dof/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Read6DOF".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Read6DOF project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/ directory,
to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

This module contains no code and therefore does not need to be compiled.
It is implemented in V only.
