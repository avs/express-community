 Read_SLPSTL
 Reader module for:
      SLP (ASCII) File Format
      STL (ASCII) File Format
      STL (BINARY) File Format
///////////////////////////////////////

   This module parses a Pro/Engineer RENDER format file (.SLP) and puts it
   into a Field with one cell_set - a triangle one. The RENDER file
   tends to have the extension .SLP. As far as I know the RENDER
   format has only two data components - NORMAL and COLOR.
   These are both read and put into the node_data, since the data is
   based on the triangle vertices. I also assume there is only one solid
   in the file - I don't know if there can be more than one...

   This module is based on my AVS5 reader, except that I have attempted
   to do some error checking, and also have not hardcoded the maximum
   number of triangles that can be read in. These are now counted and
   malloc'ed. Error checking has be added from the original by I.
   Curington, and status reporting for progress, and interrupt
   by user intervention is also supported.

   Inputs:
      filename: the name of the .SLP / .STL  file to read.

   Outputs:
      out: field with on triangle cell_set and two node_data.
      err: integer indicating read error (0 = no error, 1 = error)
      err_str: string indicating error condition, or "" for no error.

   The V user interface macro maps this to a label area
   where visibility is controlled with the err int.

This module also parses the STL (Stereo Lithography)
format, and converts patches into AVS/Express triangle
lists. This can be piped directly into the renderer.

IT is implemented in C++.

It only has one input parameter, the filename.
The module user interface is designed for standard
module useage, with a UImod_panel as the parent.

The module automatically detects the type of file, either
SLP, STL, ascii or binary. The binary version also
detects bigendian/littlendian conversion switching.
