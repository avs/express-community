PrintField
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/printfld/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the "PrintField"
project.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new PrintField project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance data_io.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Please note that the process is set to inherit from
the parent libraries (usually the express process).

Either select the library XP_COMM_PROJ.PrintField.PrintFieldMods and then choose
compile from the Project menu, or use the following VCP command:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.PrintField.PrintFieldMods

Alternatively you may compile without starting the AVS/Express application:

e.g., base -comp_proc express -exit
