Express Community StreamTime Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/streamt/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"StreamTime".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new StreamTime project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the StreamTime project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.StreamTime.StreamTimeMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/streamt/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ mappers.v and examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this
               file.

streamt.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.StreamTime library.

stmods.v       Creates the StreamTimeMods library containing the low-level module
               StreamTimeCore and the parameter block StreamTimeParams.

stmacs.v       Creates the StreamTimeMacs library containing the functional macro
               StreamTimeFunc, the UI macro StreamTimeUI and the user macro stream_time.

stapps.v       Creates the StreamTimeApps library containing the example applications
               StreamTimeEg1, StreamTimeEg2, StreamTimeEg3, StreamTimeEg4 and
               StreamTimeEg5.

streamt.cxx    The C++ source code for the StreamTimeCore module.

streamt.html   HTML documentation for the stream_time user macro.

README         This file.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx	       AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx	       AVS/Express generated source code.

streamt.o(bj)  Intermediate object file.
