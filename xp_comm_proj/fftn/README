Express Community FFTn Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/fftn/ ) contains all the V code, source
code, HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community
FFTn project "FFTn".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory,
which should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the
xp_comm_proj/, xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new FFTn project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the FFTn project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.FFTn.FFTnMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

This module uses functions in the cp_utils library (available from
Community). It must be installed before compiling this project.

Also, before compiling this project you must build and install John
Beale's fft-n library (available from
http://www.best.com/~beale/gforge/fft-n.tar.gz). As of 3/98 there is
one small patch that needs to be made to the fft-n source code

fftn.c:
330c330
<       for (i = 0; i < nTotal; i += iSign)
---
>       for (i = 0; i < iSign * nTotal; i += iSign)

Once fft-n is built and installed it will create an object file called
fftn.o. This object file is needed to build the FFTn project. Create a
link called fftn in the project directory xp_comm_proj/fftn/. The link
should point to the fft-n directory containing the fftn.o object file.
Once the link is created you can compile the FFTn project using the
VCP command given above.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/fftn directory.

INSTALL         Contains installation instructions for editing the
		xp_comm_proj.v and xp_comm_lib/ filters.v and examples.v
		files.  This file should not be edited as the future
		installation script will use this file.

FFTn.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.FFTn library.

FFTn_mods.v 	Creates the FFTnMods library containing the low-level
		module FFTn_raw and the parameter group FFTn_params.

FFTn_macs.v	Creates the FFTnMacs library containing the high-level
		macros FFTn_UI, FFTn, FFT and the example application
		FFTnEg.

FFTn_vxp.c	The C source code for the FFTn_raw module.

doc_mod.html	HTML documentation for the FFTn_raw module.

doc_umac.html	HTML documentation for the FFTn User Macro.

README		This file.


Prerequisites
-------------

This project relies on the successful installation of the following components.
Without them it will not function correctly.

John Beale's fft-n library

cp_utils project


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated.  Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h	 	AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

fftn_vxp.o	Intermediate object file.
