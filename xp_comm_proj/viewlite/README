Express Community ViewersLite Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/viewlite/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ViewersLite".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new ViewersLite project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

This project is a small library of utility functions to aid production of lite
applications. These macros require no compilation and once installed correctly
can be used straight away.
