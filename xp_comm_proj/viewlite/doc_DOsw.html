<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<blockquote>
<P>Any DataObject produces a renderable object that contains data as well as attributes for rendering. The output has a set Datamap which can be selected by the user.</p>

<p>All DataObject's have a relatively high object count, various strategies were suggested in the "White Paper" to reduce the object count of an application.These DataObjects are all pre-made macros of DataObject's, DataObjectNoTexture's and DataObjectLite's that have been combined with Datamap_Switch so they can be used to build lite applications. These macros require Developers Edition of AVS/Express and come with no user interface.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Reducing the object count of an application is the thing most likely to speed up the loading and running of an application. This is one of a library of utility macros designed to reduce the object count.</p> 

<p>These are all AVS/Express macros which as such require no compilation. Most applications are produced with AVS/Express Developers Edition and these macros also require  AVS/Express Developers Edition. They contain no UI so that the developer has as much freedom as possible.</p>

<p>A DataObject has a high object count and this is a utility library of DataObject's with a Datamap_Switch that can be used to reduce the object count, either directly or by allowing the use of a ViewersLite macro.</p>
  
<p>Many modules have a DataObject module if this occurs just before a viewer
then by altering the datamap here the colour of the final image can be 
specified. The Data Object can be pared down removing unwanted functions in a
variety of ways and the appropriate data map added directly or a selection 
of data maps added to the Data Object.</p>

<p>DataObject is  prefixed with  "DO_"</p>

<p>DataObject_NoTexture is prefixed with "DO_NT_"</p>

<p>DataObject_Lite is prefixed with "DO_LITE_"</p>

<p>Of these the DataObject have the highest object count, then the 
DataObject_NoTexture and the DataObject_Lite has the lowest count.</p>




<p>Many other properties of an object can be altered through the DataObject rather than through the view or scene, this again will reduce the size of the 
application. For example the object can be removed from a scene by putting a 
toggle on the parameter DataObject.Obj.visible  and the transparency can be 
altered by connecting DataObject.Props.trans  to a slider.</p>

<p>These techniques remove the necessity of the user having to select any of the objects in the viewer to be the current select object to alter the Datamap.</p>

<h3>Input Ports</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>As above.</b></i>
</blockquote>





<h3>Output Ports</h3>
<i><b>obj</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The renderable object that can be connected directly to a Graphics Display Kit viewer.
</blockquote>




<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
These macros are all variations of the AVS/Express standard macros DataObject, DataObjectNoTexture and DataObjectLite.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>An example application EgViewLite is provided, which shows how this switch can be connected into a DataObject to produce a rederable object with a Datamap that the user can select.</p> 

<p>This example also demonstrates the use of DataObjects altered to have a set  Datamap and how ViewersLite can be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>xp_comm_proj/viewlite/vl_macs.v</i> contains all the three DataObject macros with Datamap Switches (DO_Dmap_Switch, DO_NT_Dmap_Switch, DO_LITE_Dmap_Switch) as well as all the DataObject macros (eg DO_GreyScale), Datamap_Switch, View3DMinimal, View3D_TrackObj, View3D_TrackAll3, View2DMinimal, View2D_TrackObj, View2D_TrackAll3, ViewMinimal, View_TrackObj, View_TrackAll3 and an example EgViewLite.
</blockquote>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The macros can be acessed through the XP_COMM_PROJ library in the Templates library or through one of four libraries DataObjects_apps, Views3DLite, Views2DLite and UViewsLite all of which are in the Misc sub-library IAC library area.</p>

<p>The example EgViewLite can also be acessed through the IAC library but is located in the Examples sub-library.</P>
