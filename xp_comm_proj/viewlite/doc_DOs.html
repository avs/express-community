<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<blockquote>
This is a switch that is connected to the 7 standard Datamaps so that by altering the switch value the selected Datamap becomes the output.

<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Reducing the object count of an application is the thing most likely to speed up the loading and running of an application. This is one of a library of utility macros designed to reduce the object count.</p> 

<p>These are all AVS/Express macros which as such require no compilation. Most applications are produced with AVS/Express Developers Edition and these macros also require  AVS/Express Developers Edition. They contain no UI so that the developer has as much freedom as possible.</p>

<p>This switch can be connected into any DataObject so that the user can the select the Datamap to be used on a specific field.</p>

<p>A DataObject has a high object count and this can be used with a DataObject to reduce the object count, either directly or by allowing the use of a ViewersLite macro.</p>

<h3>Input Ports</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>index</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The index value given selects the Datamap for output:</p>
<p>0  is Default</p>
<p>1  is GreyScale</p>
<p>2  is VolumeRender</p>
<p>3  is HotMetal</p>
<p>4  is CyanYellowRed</p>
<p>5  is DefaultStep</p>
<p>6  is FilterDatamap</p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<i><b>min</b></i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The minimum value of the field to be rendered.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>max</b></i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The maximum value of the field to be rendered.
</blockquote>


<h3>Output Ports</h3>
<p><I>Datamap</i></p>
<p>A Datamap that can be connected to a DataObject and colormap that field.</P>

<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
This macro can be connected into the AVS/Express standard macros DataObject, DataObjectNoTexture and DataObjectLite.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>An example application EgViewLite is provided, which shows how this switch can be connected into a DataObject to produce a rederable object with a Datamap that the user can select.</p> 

<p>This example also demonstrates the use of DataObjects altered to have a set  Datamap and how ViewersLite can be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>xp_comm_proj/viewlite/vl_macs.v</i> contains the Datamap_Switch macro discussed here as well as all the DataObject macros (eg DO_GreyScale), DO_Dmap_Switch, DO_NT_Dmap_Switch, DO_LITE_Dmap_Switch, View3DMinimal, View3D_TrackObj, View3D_TrackAll3, View2DMinimal, View2D_TrackObj, View2D_TrackAll3, ViewMinimal, View_TrackObj, View_TrackAll3 and an example EgViewLite.
</blockquote>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The macros can be acessed through the XP_COMM_PROJ library in the Templates library or through one of four libraries DataObjects_apps, Views3DLite, Views2DLite and UViewsLite all of which are in the Misc sub-library IAC library area.</p>

<p>The example EgViewLite can also be acessed through the IAC library but is located in the Examples sub-library.</P>
