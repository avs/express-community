Express Community Slice_to_Volume Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/slc2vol/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Slice_to_Volume".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Slice_to_Volume project, and two single line additions to some of the 
xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance mappers.v and examples.v) to add a link to
the User Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library
page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.Slice_to_Volume.Slice_to_Volume_Mods in the Templates library,
and then perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command
into the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following 
command to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Slice_to_Volume.Slice_to_Volume_Mods
