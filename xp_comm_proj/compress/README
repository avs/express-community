Compress Project
----------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/compress/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for an AVS/Express field
compression tool "Compress".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Compress project, and two single line additions to some of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance misc.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library page.

It should be noted that the Zlib public domain compression library, and the 
utils_xp Community utility library project are pre-requisites. 

The source for the Zlib library may be obtained from 
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib. The instructions given with the source
should be followed to produce a linkable library. The link_files and hdr_dirs
lines in the file xp_comm_proj/compress/compress_mods.v should be altered (if 
necesaary) to give the position of the library, and of the Zlib header files
zlib.h and zconf.h.

Further information may be found in doc_mod.html and doc_umac.html.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the Compress project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or a user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Compress.CompressMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

If both the Examine_Field project and the Compress project are required, then
the cxx_src_files line in either the examine_field_mods.v file or the
compress_mods.v file should be removed or commented out (these cxx_src_files
are common to both projects, which causes errors/warnings when linking if
they are specified twice). 


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/compress/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ misc.v and examples.v files. This file should
		not be edited as the future installation script will use this
		file.

compress.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Compress library.

compmods.v	Creates the CompressMods library containing the low-level
		module Compress_Prim and the parameter group Compress_Param.

compmacs.v	Creates the CompressMacs library containing the high-level
		macros Compress_UI, Compress, compress and the example
		appplication Compress_Eg.

compress.cxx	The C++ source code for the Compress_Prim module.

deflate.c	The C source code for an interface to the general purpose 
		Zlib compression library

deflate.h	The corresponding header file, which prototypes functions.

doc_mod.html	HTML documentation for the Compress_Prim module.

doc_umac.html	HTML documentation for the compress user macro.

README		This file.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

out_hdr.h	AVS/Express generated header file.

out_src.cxx	AVS/Express generated source code.
