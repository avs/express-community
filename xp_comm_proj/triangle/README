Express Community Triangle Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/triangle/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Triangle".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Triangle project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Triangle project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Triangle.TriangleMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.



Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/triangle/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

triangle.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Triangle library.

trimods.v	Creates the TriangleMods library containing the low-level
		modules triangle, fix_voronoi_edges, compute_triangle_areas
		point_in_triangle and fault_region, and the group structure
		struct_triangulateio.

trimacs.v	Creates the TriangleMacs library containing the high-level
		macros Delauney, Voronoi, Convex_Hull, Concave_Tri,
		Triangulate_Area, Triangle_Stats and struct_to_fld.

triapps.v       Creates the TriangleApps example application library.  This
		library includes links to the following files:

triapp1.v       Concave Polygon example application.
triapp2.v       Convex Hull example application.
triapp3.v       Delauney Triangulation example application.
triapp4.v       Fault Triangulation example application.
triapp5.v       Point In Polygon example application.
triapp6.v       Voronoi Triangulation example application.
triapp7.v       Moving Fault Region and Animated Fault Region example
		applications.

tri.cxx         The C++ source code for the Triangle module.
edge.cxx        The C++ source code for the fix_voronoi_edges module.
area.cxx        The C++ source code for the compute_triangle_areas module.
point.cxx       The C++ source code for the point_in_triangle module.
fault.cxx       The C++ source code for the fault_region module.

barycent.c      Source code for Barycentric function.

tridefs.h       Community specific definitions used by triangle utility library.

triangle.c      Source code of triangle utility library.
triangle.h      Header file for triangle utility library.

triangle.html	HTML documentation for the triangle module.

dvcc.html	HTML documentation for the Delauney, Voronoi, Convex_Hull and Concave_Tri macros.

tri_area.html	HTML documentation for the Triangulate_Are macro.

README		This file.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

*.o/obj		Intermediate object files.
