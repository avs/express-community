<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<blockquote>
The Triangulate_Area macro takes a fault line and a series of boundary
segments, determines which segments the fault line crosses and
triangulates the fault line with the crossed segments. This macro is
part of a suite of modules for advanced Triangle generation and
manipulation.

<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The Triangulate_Area macro takes a fault line and a series of
boundary segments, determines which segments the fault line crosses and
triangulates the fault line with the crossed segments. Triangulate_Area
is a higher-level macro that internally uses the triangle library to do
the necessary calculations. The triangle library is a two-dimensional
quality mesh generator and delaunay triangulator. It was written by
Richard Shewchuk and more information about this library, its purpose
and how it can be used can be found at <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html</a>.
Details of the license that this library
is distributed under can be found in the <a
href="LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a> file. This suite of modules has
been used in a large AVS/Express project for geologic modeling.</p>

<p>The macro presented here combines the triangle and fault_region
low-level modules to produce a macro that is able to determine which
boundary segments a fault line crosses and then triangulate the fault
line with the crossed boundary segments. This produces a triangle grid
that can be used for further calculations and visualizations. It could,
for instance, be used as an interpolation probe. The macro also
generates a set of cell data and combines it with the input boundary
segment data. The generated cell_data contains Null data for each
segment that the fault line did cross. This allows the generated triangle mesh
to be more easily seen. More information on the tasks
that are being performed by this macro can be found on the triangle
library <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html">home-page</a>. An
example of how to use the macro can be found in the TriFaultExample
application.</p>

<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote><i><b>in_fld</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
The input field that represents the boundary segments.  The field should contain a polygon mesh.
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><b>in_fault</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
The input field that represents the fault line.  The field should contain a polyline mesh.  The polyline mesh should only contain a single fault line.  If any more are present the macro will not work correctly.
</blockquote>


<h3>Outputs</h3>

<blockquote><i><b>out_mesh</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
The output triangulated field generated from the crossed boundary segments combined with the fault line.  The output field contains a triangle mesh.
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><b>out_fld</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
The output boundary segment field generated by combining the new cell
data with the original boundary segments field. The new cell data
contains a 0 for each segment that was not crossed and a 1 for each
segment that was crossed.  The cell data is setup so that a 1 is treated
as Null data. It does not contain any other data.
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><b>out_obj</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>
The directly renderable output of the triangulate_area macro. This
output contains both the triangulated mesh and the boundary segment
field containing the new cell data. This output can be displayed in a 2D
viewer. The modes and properties of each output object are set so that
the various output objects can be identified.
</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Two utility macros are also provided along with the triangle library. These perform simpler tasks that are not done directly by the triangle library.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><code>Triangle_Stats</code></p>
<p>Takes an input triangle mesh and calculates the area of each triangle.  The calculated areas are placed into a cell data component.  The macro outputs a new field structure and a renderable DataObject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>struct_to_fld</code></p>
<p>Converts a struct_triangulateio group into a field structure.  The struct_triangulateio group is used by the low-level triangle module for both input and output.  This macro takes that group and converts it into a triangle mesh and node data component that can be used by other Express module.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The Triangle project contains 8 example applications that provide a good illustration of what the triangle library is capable of.  Most of these example use either the ClickSketch or ContinuousSketch modules to create input data. Those that use the ClickSketch module start out with a blank window and expect the user to create a polyline.  This is done by clicking the right mouse button in the viewer window.  You should see you polyline appear in red.  Once you have completed this you should click the <i>Done</i> button.  This begins the triangulation process.  Once this has finished the results are shown in the viewer window.  The ContinuousSketch module is similar except that the user should hold and drag with the right mouse button to create a trail of points.</p>

<p>The examples supplied are as follows, beginning with the ClickSketch examples.</p>

<h4>ClickSketch Examples</h4>

<ul>

<li>
<code>TriConcavePolygonExample</code><br>
Triangulates the specified Concave polygon.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriConvexHullExample</code><br>
Determines the Convex Hull that surrounds the specified polygon.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriDelauneyTriangulationExample</code><br>
Performs a Delauney triangulation of the specified polygon.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriPointInPolygonExample</code><br>
Performs a Delauney triangulation of the specified polygon. If a point is picked using a <code>CTRL</code>-click the triangle containing the picked point is determined and displayed.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriVoronoiExample</code><br>
Performs a Voronoi triangulation of the specified points.
</li>

</ul>

<h4>ContinuousSketch Examples</h4>

<ul>

<li>
<code>TriFaultExample</code><br>
Determines which cells are crossed by the specified fault line and triangulates the combined fault line and cell mesh.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriMovingRegionExample</code><br>
Determines which cells are crossed by the specified fault region and triangulates the combined fault region and cell mesh.
</li>
<li>
<code>TriAnimatedRegionExample</code><br>
Determines which cells are crossed by the specified fault region and triangulates the combined fault region and cell mesh.  The loop module can be used to rotate the fault region.  The output mesh is retriangulated after each move.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level TriangleMods library containing the low-level modules does not specify a process. By default the <tt>express</tt> process will be used.
