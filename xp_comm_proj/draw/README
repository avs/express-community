Express Community Draw Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/draw/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Draw".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Draw project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

        Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Draw project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Draw.DrawMods

        Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/draw/ directory.

INSTALL         Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
                and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
                future installation script will use this file.

draw.v          Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Draw library.

drawmods.v      Creates the DrawMods library containing the low-level modules
                SuperDrawCore, LineResamplerCore and RegionResamplerCore and
                the parameter block DrawLineParams and LineResamplerParams.

drawmacs.v      Creates the DrawMacs library containing the user interface
                macros SuperDrawUI and LineResamplerUI, the functional macros
                SuperDrawFunc and LineResamplerFunc, and the user macros
                SuperDraw, LineResampler and RegionResampler.

drawapps.v      Creates the DrawApps library containing the example applications
                SuperDrawEg, LineResamplerEg and RegionResamplerEg.

sup_draw.cxx    The C++ source code for the SuperDrawCore module.

distance.cxx    Extra C++ source code used by the SuperDrawCore module implementation.

sd_stat.h       C++ header file used by SuperDrawCore module implementation.

lnresamp.cxx    The C++ source code for the LineResamplerCore module.

rgresamp.cxx    The C++ source code for the RegionResamplerCore module.

sup_draw.html   HTML documentation for the SuperDraw user macro.

lnresamp.html   HTML documentation for the LineResampler user macro.

rgresamp.html   HTML documentation for the RegionResampler user macro.

README          This file.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

sd_gen.h        AVS/Express generated header files.
lnrs_gen.h
rgrs_gen.h

gen.cxx         AVS/Express generated source code.

*.o(bj)         Intermediate object files.
