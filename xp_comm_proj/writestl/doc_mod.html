<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
The write_stl module writes binary STL(Stereo Lithography) files based
upon the data contained in triangular cell sets. The input to the module
is a standard Mesh object which should contain one or more cell sets of
type "Tri". If the Mesh contains more than one cell set then only the
last cell set will be written to the STL file. The triangular cell set
is written to file according to the binary STL format. Facet normal
vectors are calculated and written to file. The attribute block is not
used and null data is written to it.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
It is intended that the write_stl module should be used to write the output of
a visualization module to a STL file.  Many visualization modules, such as
isosurface, output field data containing a single triangular cell set.  By using
this module these results can be conviently output as an STL file for further
manipulation.  As most of these visualization modules output only a single cell
set the way that the write_stl module treats multiple cell sets should not be
a problem.  Naturally, this module can be used with any Meshes that contain
suitable triangular cell sets.  However it is most easily used when combined with
visualization modules, such as isosurface.  An example of this is shown in
WriteSTLEg.

<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>&amp;in</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the Mesh that contains the triangular cell set
that is to be written to the STL file.  If no triangular cell sets are present
then an error message will be given.  If multiple triangular cell sets
are present then the last cell set only will be written to the STL file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>filename</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The name of the file that should be written to. This parameter is of type string.
Note that if an existing file is specified the module will not warn that the 
original file is being overwritten.  If error-checking of this type is required
then it should be provided at a higher level.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>trigger</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This parameter is used to notify the module that the output file should be written.
The parameter is of type int.  Whenever the value of this parameter is set the 
write_stl module is notified.  This causes the module to read the current input
mesh and create the corresponding STL file.  If this parameter can be connected to
a UIButton component to create a simple user interface.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>err</b></i><br>
<i><b>err_str</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
These two parameters control the output of error messages.  The <i><b>err</b></i>
parameter is an int value that is set to 1 whenever an error occurs.  This parameter 
can therefore be used to control the display of error messages in the user interface.
The <i><b>err_str</b></i> parameter is a string value that is used to return error
messages from the write_stl module.  The writeSTL user macro shows now it is possible
to use the state of the <i><b>err</b></i> parameter to control the display of the
text in the <i><b>err_str</b></i> parameter.
</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level write_stl module is used in the User Macro writeSTL.  This can be
used as is in applications.  An example of how it can be used is shown in
WriteSTLEg.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
An example application WriteSTLEg is provided, which calculates an isosurface of
the hydrogen volume data.  The resulting mesh can be written to a user specified
STL file.  This file can subsequently be read by either the IAC ReadSLPSTL project
or other programs that use the binary STL file format.
</blockquote>


<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<I>xp_comm_proj/writestl/wrstmods.v</I> contains the write_stl module V definition.
</blockquote>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level WriteSTLMods library containing the module
write_stl does not specify a process. By default the express
process will be used.
