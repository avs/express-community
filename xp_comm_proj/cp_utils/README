Express Community cp_utils Library
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/cp_utils/ ) contains all the source code the
Community cp_utils library.  This library is not a project, it is a library
of functions used by several other projects.  There is no V code as
this library defines no modules or macros.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory,
which should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the
xp_comm_proj/, xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

Installation is simply a matter of unpacking xp_comm_proj/cp_utils and its
contents.  Projects that use cp_utils will set properties c_src_files
and hdr_dirs to make use of cp_utils.

There is no need to compile this library.  It will be automatically
compiled when projects that use cp_utils are compiled.
