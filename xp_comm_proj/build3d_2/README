Express Community Build3D_2 Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/build3d_2/ ) contains all the V code, HTML
documentation, and installation information for the Community project "Build3D_2".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Build3D_2 project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Build3D_2.Build3D_2_Mods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.
