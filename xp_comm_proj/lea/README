LEA Advector module
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/lea/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the LEA ADvector
project.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new LEA Advector project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify this project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.LEA.LEAMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Other Comments
--------------

As the LEA Advector module uses an external library you might need to change
the avsenv file. If there are problems compiling change the last line of the 
avsenv file to include the absolute path of the directory instead of a '.'

change the following line:

	XP_PATH=. $XP_ROOT

to
	XP_PATH=<absolute_path> $XP_ROOT  

i.e.:

	XP_PATH=C:\iac $XP_ROOT

README         This file.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/mappers.v and exampples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this
               file.

lea.v          Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.LEA library.

lea_lib.v      Creates the LEALib library that integrates the build of the lea 
               library (liblea.a) into the module build procedure.

lea_mods.v     Creates the LEAMods library containing the low-level module 
               LEACore and the LEAParams parameter block.

lea_macs.v     Creates the LEAMacs library containing the high-level 
               functional macro LEAFunc, user interface macro LEAUI and
               the user macro LEA_Advector as well as the support macros
               LEAUIParams, AdvectionUI, LICUI, VMaskUI and ComputationUI.

lea_apps.v     Creates the LEAApps library containing the example 
               application LEA_Example.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h          AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx        AVS/Express generated C++ source file.

*.o(bj)        Intermediate object files.
