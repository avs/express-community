This  is the  LEA lib  (Lagrangian Eulerian  Advection Library)  to compute
https://github.com/avs/express-community
texture-based representations of 2D unsteady vector field.

GENERAL
------

This library is  an implementation of the algorithm  described in the paper
"Lagrangian-Eulerian Advection for  Unsteady Flow Visualization" written by
Bruno Jobard, Gordon Erlebacher and M.Y.  Hussaini. Paper and videos can be
downloaded here:
http://www.cscs.ch/~bjobard/Research/Publications/vis2001/lea_paper.htm

The distribution comes with the library source code (in the directory src/)
and with an interactive demonstration program (src_demo/) called leaflow.


DEMO
----

To demonstrate  the fast computation of  LEA textures, the  leaflow demo is
based  on  an  interactive  vector   field  generation  done  by  Jos  Stam
http://www.dgp.utoronto.ca/people/stam/reality/Research/StableFluids/ 

The  vector field generation  requires the  Fast Fourier  Transform library
FFTW that can be downloaded here: http://www.fftw.org/download.html
However, the LEA library can be compiled without the FFTW library.

To  use the  demo, launch  src_demo/leaflow and  drag your  mouse  into the
window. Change parameters via the right mouse button or keyboard.
