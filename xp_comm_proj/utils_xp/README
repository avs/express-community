utils_xp source files
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/utils_xp/ ) contains the source code and 
documentation for a set of utility functions for AVS/Express.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

Installation is simply a matter of unpacking xp_comm_proj/utils_xp and its
contents. Projects that use utils_xp will set properties cxx_src_files,
hdr_dirs and cxx_hdr_dirs to make use of utils_xp.

There is no need to compile any of the source files. They are automatically
compiled when projects that use utils_xp are compiled.
