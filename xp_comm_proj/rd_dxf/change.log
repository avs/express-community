	* Changes to the files of /rddxf-p2.0/rd_dxf

	* Version 1.0: 30/7/97 
		Original files as given.
	
	* Version 1.1: 7/8/97  
		A lot of DXF files added in dxf_files, courtesy of AVS.
		Two extra entities, DXFArc and DXFRay added.
	

	* Version 1.2: 19/8/97
		Creates an error file showing those entities not read.
		Further entities added. DXFArc and DXFRay implemented.


	* Version 1.3: 1/9/97
		Several other entities have header and code files added, 
		although not all are implemented yet. They are:
			3DSolid
			Ellipse
			Insert
			Leader
			PLine
		Code which is already written is changed to correct a few bugs
		- especially the DXFLine.cxx module. 

	* Version 1.4: 12/9/97
		As much of the code as possible has been amended to enable the
		introduction of a block reader. This has meant rewriting parts
		of the DXFFile module which was unable to cope with the 
		additions.

	* Version 1.5: 17/9/97
		The block reader is part completed. It reads in blocks and 
		stores their names, but does not yet set up a database to 
		record the entities.

    * Version 1.6: 30/9/97
        Set tablesHead and tablesTail to null in DXFfile constructor
        (fixed crash on PC)
        Allow user to specify whether plines & circles (also
        ellipses when implemented) should be filled (Express 
        polyhedron field) or outline (Express line field)
        Allow cell data to be attached - at present this is 
        hardwired to 39 (line thickness) 
        Rewrote user interface to include reverse_normals & 
		fill_polygons - stored in separate v file for DXF_UI 
		library.
		Added rd_dxf_params object in DXF_COMP library.
		Rewrote read_dxf.v and rd_adj_dxf.v to use this
		interface.
		Removed one DXF library
		Prevented erroneous error messages from DXFPrim::Make

	* Version 1.7: 2/10/97
	    Added code to store color and flags associated with a layer 
		definition and to use the appropriate color for any entity
		associated with a layer. Node data is now RGB, with 1 - 7 given 
		somewhat arbitrary colors, and everything else being white.
		Needs a lookup table of some sort.

	* Version 1.8: 3/10/97
	    Added code to extract text information. This is exported as
		a Point Mesh and an array of strings - these can be input to 
		text_glyph.

    	* Version 4.0: 26/11/97

           -added message to indicate which entities are being ignored
           -removed debugging code being output to screen
           -added UIlabel to display current version no and date
	   -Current state of Entities is shown below:

  1). when a DXF file of an ellipse is created the rotation information is
      not saved.  The information which is (centerpoint and axesendpoint)
      are interpreted correctly.  This is under further investigation.

   
  2) simply displaying one text string at each point. Information such
     as scaling and rotation is ignored.

	* Version 4.1: 28/11/97

	- handle with extrusion directions in all entitys implemented yet

        module.

      - Wrote standardized IAC project documentation for readDXF user macro.

      - Moved unused code into ReadDXFUnsupported library.

      - Added support for AVS/Express environment variables (e.g. $XP_PATH<>)
