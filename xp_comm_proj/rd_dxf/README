Express Community ReadDXF Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------

The directories ( xp_comm_proj/rd_dxf/ ) contain all the V code, source code,
documentation, and installation information for the new Community project "ReadDXF".

The directories should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new ReadDXF project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the
new project may be compiled. The "express" process is specified by the 
project. The project may be compiled by using one of the following commands
in the top-level directory of your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

        Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.
