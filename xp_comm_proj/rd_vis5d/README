Express Community ReadVis5D Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/rd_vis5d/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ReadVis5D".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/ directory
to add links to the User Macro and Example Applications to the top-level
Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadVis5D.ReadVis5DMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.



Files

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/rd_vis5d/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/data_io.v and xp_comm_lib/examples.v files. This file
               should not be edited as the future installation script will
               use this file.

rd_vis5d.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.ReadVis5D library.

rv5dmods.v     Creates the ReadVis5DMods library containing the parameter
               blocks ReadVis5DParams and ReadVis5DTopography and the low-level
               modules ReadVis5DCore and ReadTopoCore.

rv5dmacs.v     Creates the ReadVis5DMacs library containing the UI macros
               LoopUI, WindSelectUI, ReadVis5DUI and ReadVis5DTopographyUI,
               the functional macros ReadVis5DFunc and ReadVis5DTopographyFunc
               and the user macros ReadVis5D and ReadVis5DTopography.
			   
rv5dapps.v     Creates the ReadVis5DApps library containing the example 
               applications ReadVis5DEg, ReadVis5DTopographyEg and 
               ReadVis5DStreamlinesEg.

completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

RdTopgen.h     
RdV5Dgen.h     AVS/Express generated header files.

RdTopgen.cxx     
RdV5Dgen.cxx   AVS/Express generated C++ source files.

*.o/obj        Intermediate object files.
