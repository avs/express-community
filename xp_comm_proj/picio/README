Read Bio-Rad PIC Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/picio/ ) contains all the V code, HTML
documentation, and installation information for the Read Bio-Rad PIC
project "PIC_IO".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add
the new project, and two single line additions to two of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance data_io.v and examples.v) to add a link to the
User Macro and the Example Application from the top-level Community library
page.

The low-level module does not need compiling.
