Express Community ZipIO Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/zip_io/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ZipIO".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new ZipIO project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

        Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the ZipIO project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.ZipIO.ZipIOMods

	If the project is placed in any process except for the normal "express"
process then it must be linked with an external copy of the zlib library.  It
is not possible to link it with the Express animator library.  Please the project
documentation for more information on this.

        Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/zip_io/ directory.

INSTALL         Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
                and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
                future installation script will use this file.

zip_io.v        Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.ZipIO library.

zip_mods.v      Creates the ZipIOMods library containing the low-level
                modules CompressFileCore and DecompressFileCore, and the
                parameter block ZipIOParams.

zip_macs.v      Creates the ZipIOMacs library containing the user
                interface macros CompressFileUI and DecompressFileUI and the 
                user macros compress_file and decompress_file.

zip_apps.v	Creates the ZipIOApps library containing the example applications
                WriteCompressedImageEg and ReadCompressedImageEg.

comp.c          The C source code for the CompressFileCore module.

decomp.c        The C source code for the DecompressFileCore module.

fn_util.c       C source code for filename manipulation functions used by the
fn_util.h       low-level module code.

zip_io.html     HTML documentation for the compress_file and decompress_file
                user macros.

README          This file.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h           AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx         AVS/Express generated source code.

comp.o(bj)     Intermediate object files.
decomp.o(bj)
fn_util.o(obj)
