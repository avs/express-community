Express Community DICOM_Orthoslice Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/dcmortho/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community DICOM_Orthoslice 
project.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new project, and a single line addition to one of the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this
instance mappers.v) to add a link to the User Macro from the new top-level
Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit

or      make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.DICOMOrtho.DICOMOrthoMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/dcmortho/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/mappers.v file. This file should not be edited as
               the future installation script will use this file.

dcmortho.v     Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.DICOMOrtho library.

dcmomods.v     Creates the DICOMOrthoMods library containing the low-level 
               module DICOM_orthoslice_unif.

dcmomacs.v     Creates the DICOMOrthoMacs library containing the high-level
               user macro DICOM_Orthoslice, functional macro 
               DICOM_Orthoslice_Unif and user interface macro
               DICOM_Orthoslice_UI.

dcmoapps.v     Creates the DICOMOrthoApps library containing the example
               application macro DICOM_OrthosliceEg.
			
dcmounif.cxx   The C++ source code for the module.

dcmortho.html  HTML documentation for the User Macro.

README         This file.

completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h          AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx        AVS/Express generated source code.

dcmounif.o     Intermediate object file.
