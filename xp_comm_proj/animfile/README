Express Community Animate Filename Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/animfile/ ) contains all the V code, HTML
documentation, and installation information for the Community Animate Filename
project "AnimFilename".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new AnimFilename project, and a single line addition to xp_comm_lib/ data_io.v
file, to add a link to the User Macro from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the new project should be ready
to use - there are no low-level modules that require compilation.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/animfile/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/data_io.v and examples.v files. This file should

afn_mods.v	Creates the AnimFilenameMods library containing the low-level
		module AnimFilenameGen, a variation of the AVS/Express loop
		module called AnimFilenameLoop, and the parameter groups
		AnimFilenameParams and AnimLoopParams.
