Changes included in Version 1.1 - February 21, 2001
---------------------------------------------------

Note
----

The previous version 1.0 was not released publicly.


Bug fixes
---------

- mixed zone type (structured and unstructured) with only some having data and others not,
  caused incorrect assignment of data variables (Solutions) to Fields [solved]
- not supported data variable types caused general abort of reading, instead of skipping that
  data [solved]
- one second order cell had wrong CGNS-to-AVS vertex reordering [solved]
- reading a new CGNS file left Base selection at previous value [solved for PC]

Enhancements
------------

- status/interrupt
- full NGON_n support (up to 20 vertices)
- more UI information
- removed unused UI elements
- minor code cleaning
- test cases for all supported cell types

Known problems
--------------

- UNIX only: reading a new CGNS file leaves the Base selection at previous value while
  internal structures are set for the first Base. Solution for PC does not
  work with the Motif widget
- mixed two dimentional (XY,XZ,YZ) grids will all be converted to XY space
  (example: two 2D Zones, one with grid of XY and the other defined as YZ - both Zones
  will appear to be defined in the XY space)
