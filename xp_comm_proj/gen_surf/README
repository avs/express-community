Express Community GenerateSurface Example Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/gen_surf/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community GenerateSurface
Example project "GenerateSurface".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new GenerateSurface project, and two single line additions to some of the 
xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance mappers.v and examples.v) to add a link to 
the User Macro and the Example Application from the new top-level Community library
page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. Users of the Developer's Edition may select the
library XP_COMM_PROJ.GenerateSurface.GenerateSurfaceMods in the Templates library,
and then perform a compile. Alternatively, you may type the following command
into the VCP prompt; Visualization Edition users must type the following
command to compile the project, as there is no access to the Templates library
through the Network Editor:

$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.GenerateSurface.GenerateSurfaceMods
