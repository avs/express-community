<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>The Read_Hess_File module allows files in the "Hess" file format to be read into AVS/Express. The Hess file format is used by CFD panel methods. It is also very close to the "PANAIR" format that is used by the North-American Aerospace industry. The module takes the geometry from the Hess file and generates a poly-tristrip that is placed into an Express field. The read_hess user macro enhances the module further by including an user interface and by generating a renderable DataObject. Hess format files typically have a&nbsp;".n3d" extension.
</blockquote>


<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote><b><i>filename</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>
Name of the Tin&nbsp;.N3D file to be read. The parameter is of type string. This is the only input parameter to the Read_Hess_File module.
</blockquote>


<h3>Outputs</h3>

<blockquote><b><i>out_fld</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The output field containing field data constructed from the
data present in the Hess file.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><i>out_obj</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>A DataObject created from the data present in the Hess file, that is suitable for direct connection to a viewer.</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level Read_Hess_File module is used in the User Macro read_hess. Additionally, the user macro also uses the ReadHessUI UI Macro.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>An example application ReadHessEg is provided, which allows a Hess file to be loaded and allows the data to be mirrored around the X,Y and Z axis. Unfortunately no example data files are available for distribution with this module.</blockquote>


<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote><i>xp_comm_proj/rd_hess/hessmods.v</i> contains the V definition of the Read_Hess_File module.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>xp_comm_proj/rd_hess/hessmacs.v</i> contains the V definitions of the ReadHessUI User Interface Macro, the read_hess User macro and the ReadHessEg example application.</blockquote>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>The low-level ReadHessMods library containing the module Read_Hess_File does not specify a process. By default the <tt>express</tt> process will be used.</blockquote>
