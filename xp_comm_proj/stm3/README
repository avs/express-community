README for the STM3 Chemistry Visualization Toolkit
https://github.com/avs/express-community
===================================================

	Created by Mario Valle (CSCS) based on the "See The Molecule" toolkit from Ken Flurchick, Libero Bartolotti, Theresa Windus, Mark Reed
	(North Carolina Supercomputing Center) and the enhancements from Jean M. Favre (CSCS).
	
	The idea behind STM3 is not to build a replacement of well know Molecular Visualization applications, but to have a framework in which
	specific "strange" or "advanced" visualization functionalities can be integrated.
	
	The functionalities are somehow specific to CSCS requirements. This means that not everything is here, but everything can be added...
	For question or suggestion contact me at mvalle@cscs.ch
		
	For the main entry point to the module documentation go under the STM3 install
	directory (xp_comm_proj/stm3) and open the file help/STM3/index.html
	
	The simplest method to get started with STM3 is to instantiate one of the Full Apps applications and modify it.
	
	More informations on STM3 and an image gallery can be found on: http://www.cscs.ch/projects/AVSChemistry.html
	
	The STM3 toolkit has been tested under Linux RedHat 7.2, Linux RedHat 8.0, Windows 98/2000 and SGI IRIX64 6.5
	STM3 is built on top of AVS/Express 6.2
	

	Installation prerequisite is the catmull2 module from Community.
