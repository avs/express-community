<h1>STM3: See The Molecule 3</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea behind STM3 is not to build a replacement of well know Molecular Visualization applications, but to have a framework in which specific "strange" or "advanced" visualization functionalities can be integrated.</p>	

<p>The functionalities are somehow specific to CSCS requirements. This means that not everything is here, but everything can be added...</p>

<p>For question or suggestion contact me at mvalle@cscs.ch</p>
		
<p>For the main entry point to the module documentation go under the STM3 install directory (xp_comm_proj/stm3) and open the file help/STM3/index.html</p>
	
<p>The simplest method to get started with STM3 is to instantiate one of the Full Apps applications and modify it.</p>
	
<p>More informations on STM3 and an image gallery can be found on: http://www.cscs.ch/projects/AVSChemistry.html</p>
	
<p>The STM3 toolkit has been tested under Linux RedHat 7.2, Linux RedHat 8.0, Windows 98/2000 and SGI IRIX64 6.5</p>

<p>STM3 is built on top of AVS/Express 6.2</p>

<p> 
This project is classified as a special project by the IAC. Therefore we cannot offer the same level of support for this project as we do for other projects.
