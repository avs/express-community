<b>VisApi fld-format draft specification</b></h2> This is an internal document
decribing the VisApi fld format. It is based on the AVS/Express Field
format. The documentation is a modified copy of the original documentation in
AVS/Express 3.4 section 2.4. It has to be rewritten before being published! The
format will be supported for input and output in VisApi version 2.0.

<ul>
<li>
<b>dim = value (required)</b></li>

<br>The number of computational dimensions in the field. E.g. for an image,
ndim = 2 and for a volume, ndim = 3.
<br><b><font color="#009900">Extended</font><font color="#000000">:</font></b>Maybe
any value greater 0!
<li>
<b>dimX = value (required)</b></li>

<br>Size of field in computational dimension X (0 &lt; X &lt;= dim).
<li>
<b>nspace = value (required)</b></li>

<br>The dimensionality of the physical space that corresponds to the computational
space (number of physical coordinates per field element). In many cases,
the values of nspace and ndim are the same - the physical and computational
spaces have the same dimensionality. But you might embed a 2D computational
field in 3D physical space to define a manifold; or you might embed a 1D
computational field in 3D physical space to define an arbitrary set of
points (a "scatter").
<li>
<b>veclen = value (required)</b></li>

<br>The number of data values for each field element. All the data values
must be of the same primitive type (for example, integer), so that the
collection of values is conceptually a veclen-dimensional vector. If veclen=1,
the single data value is, effectively, a scalar. Thus, the term scalar
field is often used to describe such a field.
<li>
<b>data = { byte | integer | float | double } (required)</b></li>

<br>The primitive data type of all the data values.&nbsp; xdr_integer,
sdr_float, and xdr_double may also be specified.&nbsp; If Auto is selected
on input, read_field will examine the data= field.&nbsp; If the specification
is unqualified, it assumes the file is written in the native format for
the platform ("big-endian" vs "little-endian").&nbsp; If it is xdr_value,
it will read it as Sun MicroSystems' external data format (XDR) and translate
it into the native format.&nbsp; If Portable is selected, it assumes XDR
format no matter what is placed here.
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Restricted</font><font color="#000000">: </font></b><font color="#000000">No
xdr_value support. See filetype option!</font>
<li>
<b>field = { uniform | rectilinear | irregular | adaptivegrid | sparsegrid
| octree } (required)</b></li>

<br>The field type. A uniform, adaptivegrid, sparsegrid and octree field
has no computational-to-physical space mapping. The field implicitly takes
its mapping from the organization of the computational array of field elements.
<br>For a rectilinear field, each array index in each dimension of the
computational space is mapped to a physical coordinate. This produces a
physical space whose axes are orthogonal, but the spacing among elements
is not necessarily equal.
<br>For an irregular field, there is no restriction on the correspondence
between computational space and physical space. Each element in the computational
space is assigned its own physical coordinates.
<br><b><font color="#009900">Extended</font><font color="#000000">:</font></b><font color="#000000">
Adaptivegrid, sparsegrid and octree field type added.</font>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Restricted</font><font color="#000000">: </font></b><font color="#000000">No
rectilinear field type support since this is considered to be not so important
for the first versions!</font>
<li>
<b>min_ext = x-value [y-value] [z-value]... (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>max_ext = x-value [y-value] [z-value]... (optional)</b></li>

<br>The minimum and maximum coordinate value that any member data point
occupies in space, for each axis in the data. If you do not supply this
value, Read_Field calculates it and stores it in the output AVS/Express
field data structure. This value can be used by modules downstream to,
for example, size the volume bounds drawn around the data in the Geometry
Viewer or put minimum and maximum values on coordinate parameter manipulator
dials (probe). Values can be separated by blanks and/or commas. If you
do not know the extents, don't guess - let Read_Field calculate them. Most
downstream modules use whatever values are supplied, without checking their
validity. If the wrong numbers are specified, incorrect results will be
computed.
<li>
a<b>ttributes = value (optional)</b></li>

<br>The number of attributes. By default the number of attributes is equal
to veclen and each attribute is a scalar attribute.&nbsp; See attrDimX!
<br><b><font color="#009900">Added!</font></b>
<li>
<b>attrdimX = value (optional)</b></li>

<br>The dimension of attribute X (0 &lt; X &lt;= attributes). The data
values are mapped to the attribute values. The first attrDim1 data values
are mapped to attribute1, attribute2 has attrDim2 values that consist of
the data values with startindex attrDim1 + 1 and endindex attrDim1 + attrDim2
and so on.
<br><b><font color="#009900">Added!</font></b>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">dataloc = { cell | node } (optional)</font></b></li>

<br><font color="#000000">Only suppported for uniform and adaptivegrid
field types!</font>
<br><b><font color="#009900">Added!</font></b>
<li>
<b>label = string1 [string2] [string3]... (optional)</b></li>

<br>Allows you to title the individual attributes in a vector of values.
These labels are stored in the output AVS/Express field data structure.
Subsequent modules that work on the individual vector elements (for example,
extract scalar) will label their parameter widgets with the strings provided
here instead of the default "Channel 0, Channel 1...", and so on. You can
either use one label line as shown here, or separate label lines as shown
in the example above. In either case, the labels are applied to the attributes
in the order encountered. Any alphanumeric string is acceptable. You can
separate strings with blanks and/or commas.
<li>
<b>unit = string1 [string2] [string3]... (optional)</b></li>

<br>Allows you to specify a string that describes the unit of measurement
for each attribute. You can either use one unit line as shown here, or
separate unit lines as shown in the example above. In either case, the
unit specifications are applied to the attributes in the order encountered.
Any alphanumeric string is acceptable. You can separate strings with blanks
and/or commas.
<li>
<b>min_val = value [value] [value]... (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>max_val = value [value] [value]... (optional)</b></li>

<br>For each data element in a scalar or vector field, allows you to specify
the minimum and maximum data values. These values are stored in the output
AVS/Express field data structure. This is used by subsequent modules that
need to normalize the data. Values can be separated by blanks and/or commas.
<br>Read_Field does not calculate these values if you do not supply them
(unlike min_ext and max_ext). If you do not know these values, don't guess
- just leave these optional lines out. In this case, the write field module
can, at your instruction, compute these values when it creates an AVS field
file. Most downstream modules use whatever values are supplied, without
checking their validity. If the wrong numbers are specified, incorrect
results will be computed.
<li>
<b>variable n file=filespec filetype=type skip=n offset=m stride=p</b></li>

<li>
<b>coord n file=filespec filetype=type skip=n offset=m stride=p</b></li>

<li>
<b>structure n file=filespec filetype=type skip=n offset=m stride=p</b></li>

<br>(All of these specifications must be on a single line. There is no
support for continuation characters.) variable specifies where to find
data information, its type, and how to read it. coord specifies where to
find coordinate information, its type, and how to read it. It is used when
the data is rectilinear or irregular. structure specifies the where to
find the coordinate information for the hierarchical adaptive field types
like adaptivegrid, sparsegrid and octree.
<br><b><font color="#009900">Extended</font><font color="#000000">:</font></b><font color="#000000">
structure specification added for adaptivegrid, sparsegrid and octree field types.</font>
<p>The individual parameters are interpreted as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>n</b> - An integer value that specifies which element of a data vector
or which coordinate (1 for x, 2 for y, 3 for z, and so on) the subsequent
read instructions apply to. n does not default to 1 and must be specified.</li>

<li>
<b>file = filespec</b> - The name of the file containing the data or coordinates.
The filespec can be an absolute full pathname to a file, or it can be a
filespec relative to the directory that contains the field ASCII header.&nbsp;
For example, an absolute pathname might be /home/myuserid/experiment/data.&nbsp;
In a relative pathname specification, if the ASCII file of field parsing
instructions exists in the file /home/myuserid/experiment/readit.fld and
the data and coordinates file are in the subdirectory /home/myuserid/experiment/data,
you can name these files as xdata/xyzs and data/values.&nbsp; The advantage
of this second approach is that you can move the directories containing
your data around without having to change the contents of the ASCII parsing
instruction file.</li>

<li>
<b>filetype = ascii</b> - ascii means that the data or coordinate information
is in an ASCII file. In ASCII files, float data can be specified in either
real (0.1) or scientific notation (1.00000e-01) format interchangeably.</li>

<li>
<b>filetype = unformatted</b> - the file is written in FORTRAN unformatted
format.&nbsp; (FORTRAN unformatted data is binary data with additional
words written at the beginning and end of each data block stating the number
of bytes or words in the data block.)&nbsp; In general, Read_Field can
read unformatted files where all variables of one type (for example, all
the X coordinates) were output as one "record" in a single write statement.&nbsp;
This is usually the case.</li>

<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Restricted</font><font color="#000000">:</font></b><font color="#000000">No
unformatted filetype support!</font>
<li>
<b>filetype = binary</b> - the file is written in straight binary format,
such as that produced by UNIX output routines, write and fwrite. See the
warning on binary compatibility among different hardware platforms in&nbsp;
Section 5.73, Read_Field. In each case, Read_Field will use the data type
specified in the earlier data={byte,float,integer,double} statement when
it interprets the file.</li>

<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Restricted</font><font color="#000000">:</font></b><font color="#000000">No
binary filetype support!</font>
<li>
<b>skip = n</b> - For ascii files, skip specifies the number of lines to
skip over before starting to read the data. Lines are demarked by newline
characters. For binary or unformatted files, skip specifies the number
of bytes to skip over before starting to read the data. There are two motivations
for skip. First, data files often include header information irrelevant
to the AVS/Express field data type. Second, if the file contains, for example,
all X data values, then all Y data values, skip provides a way to space
across the irrelevant data to the correct starting point. You can only
use skip once at the start of the file. There is no way to skip, read,
stride, then skip again. You must simply know what value to use for skip
based on your knowledge of the software that produced the original data
file, the number of data elements, and the type (byte, float, double, integer,
etc.) skip defaults to 0.</li>

<li>
<b>offset = m</b> - offset is only relevant to ASCII files; it is ignored
for binary&nbsp; and unformatted files. offset specifies the number of
columns to space over before starting to read the first datum. (The stride
specification determines how subsequent data are read.) Hence, to read
the fourth column of numbers in an ASCII file, use offset=3. In ASCII files,
columns must be separated by one or more blank characters. Commas, semicolons,
TAB characters, and so on, are not recognized as delimiters. If necessary,
edit ASCII files to meet this restriction. offset defaults to 0 (the first
column, no columns spaced over).</li>

<li>
<b>stride = p</b> - stride assumes you are "standing on" the data value
just read. stride specifies how many "strides" must be taken to get to
the next data value. In ASCII files, stride means stride forward p delimited
items. In binary and unformatted files, stride means stride forward p times
the size of the data type (byte, float, double, integer). In a file where
the data or coordinate values are sequential, one after the other, the
stride would be 1. Note that this presumes homogeneous data in binary and
unformatted files - double-precision values could not be intermixed with
single precision values. stride defaults to 1. The stride value will be
repeatedly used until the number of data items indicated by the product
of the dimensions (for example, dim1 * dim2 *&nbsp; dim3) have been read.</li>
