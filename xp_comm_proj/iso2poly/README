Express Community Isoline2Polyline Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/iso2poly/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Isoline2Polyline".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Isoline2Polyline project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Isoline2Polyline project, and elect to specify the
process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be
compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following
command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Isoline2Polyline.Isoline2PolylineMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/iso2poly/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v

		future installation script will use this file.

iso2poly.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Isoline2Polyline library.

i2p_mods.v	Creates the Isoline2PolylineMods library containing the
		low-level module Isoline2PolylineCore, and the parameter group
		Isoline2PolylineParams.

i2p_macs.v	Creates the Isoline2PolylineMacs library containing the
		high-level macros expand_polyline_coords, Isoline2PolylineUI,
		Isoline2PolylineFunc and isoline2polyline.

i2p_apps.v	Creates the Isoline2PolylineApps library containing the example

completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx		AVS/Express generated source code.

iso2poly.o/obj	Intermediate object file.
