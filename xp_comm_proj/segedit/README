Express Community SegmentationEditor Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
------------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/segedit/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community region growing
module "SegmentationEditor".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new SegmentationEditor project, and a single line addition to an xp_comm_lib/
file (in this instance mappers.v) to add a link to the User
Macro from the new top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of
the new project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process
unspecified, it will by default use the "express" process. Doing so
means the module may be compiled by using one of the following
commands in the top-level directory of your project (whilst
AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit

or	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file
already exists, and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the Region project, and specify the process as "user"
or another user-defined process, then the module may
be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.SegmentationEditor.SegmentationEditorMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project
menu.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/segedit/ directory.

INSTALL			Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
				and xp_comm_lib/mappers.v file. This file should not be edited as
				the future installation script will use this
				file.

segedit.v		Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.SegmentationEditor library.

segedmod.v		Creates the SegmentationEditorMods library containing the 
				low-level modules DrawMask and SegmentationEditorCore as well
				as the parameter group SegmentationEditorParams.

segedmac.v		Creates the SegmentationEditorMacs library containing the 
				high-level macros SegmentationEditorFunc, SegmentationEditorUI 
				and SegmentationEditor. It also contains the support macros 
				bounds_dual, mask_display, UIsegeditRadioBoxLabel, RegionGrowUI,
				and ThresholdUI which are used by the high level macros.

segedapp.v		Creates the SegmentationEditorApps library containing the examle 
				applications SegmentationEditorEg.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen_mask.h
gen_seg.h		AVS/Express generated C++ header files.

gen.cxx			AVS/Express generated C++ source file.

drawmask.o(bj)	Intermediate object file.

segedit.o(bj)	Intermediate object file.
