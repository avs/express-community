Tube generation module
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/tube/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for a tube generation
project - tube.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Tube project, and additions to one or more of files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Tube project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Common.CommonMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/tube/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/ mappers.v and examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use this
               file.

tube.v         Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Tube library.

tubemods.v     Creates the the low-level module tube and TubeParams.

tubemacs.v     Creates the high-level macros Tube, TubeUI, tube, TubeEg1
               and TubeEg2

tube.cxx       The C++ source code for the tube module.

tube.html      HTML documentation for the tube module.

README         This file.


Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx	        AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx	        AVS/Express generated source code.

tube.o(bj)      Intermediate object file.
