Compress Tool Project
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/comptool/ ) contains all the V code, HTML
documentation, and installation information for an AVS/Express field
compression tool macro "Compress_Tool".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Compress_Tool project, and two single line additions to some of the
xp_comm_lib/ files (in this instance misc.v and examples.v) to add a link to
the user macro and the example application from the new top-level Community
library page.

It should be noted that this project is a macro, which includes the user
macros of the Compress and Examine_Field projects, and unites their ui's
into a single panel. Thus these two projects are pre-requisites.

As both the Examine_Field project and the Compress project are required, the
the cxx_src_files line in either the efldmods.v file or the
compmods.v file should be removed or commented out (these cxx_src_files
are common to both projects, which causes errors/warnings when linking if
they are specified twice). 

Installation is simply a matter of unpacking xp_comm_proj/comptool, and
installing the files as directed in the INSTALL file. No compilation is 
necessary for this project (but compilation is necessary for the 
pre-requisite projects).
