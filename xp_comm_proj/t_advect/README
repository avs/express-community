Express Community TailedAdvector Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
--------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/t_advect/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"TailedAdvector".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new TailedAdvector project, and additions to two files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the TailedAdvector project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.TailedAdvector.TailedAdvectorMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/t_advect/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
		and xp_comm_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

t_advect.v	Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.TailedAdvector template library.

tadvmods.v	Creates the TailedAdvectorMods library containing the low-level
		module TailedAdvectorCore, the utility module Synchronize and the
		parameter block TailedAdvectorParams.

tadvmacs.v	Creates the TailedAdvectorMacs library containing the user interface
		macro TailedAdvectorUI, the functional macro TailedAdvectorFunc and
		the user macros tailed_advector, TimeDependentAdvector and
		AltTimeDependentAdvector.

tadvapps.v	Creates the example applications SingleTailedAdvectorEg,
		DualTailedAdvectorEg and TimeDependentAdvectorEg.

t_advect.c	The C source code for the low-level TailedAdvectorCore module.

fld_util.c	The C source code and header file for routines used by t_advect.c
fld_util.h

t_advect.html	HTML documentation for the tailed_advector user marcro,
		and associated modules.

t_dep_av.html	HTML documentation for the TimeDependentAdvector and 
		AltTimeDependentAdvector user marcros.

README		This file.

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h		AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.c		AVS/Express generated source code.

t_advect.o/obj	Intermediate object files.
fld_util.o/obj
