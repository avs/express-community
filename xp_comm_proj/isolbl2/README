Express Community "Isoline Label 2" Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/isolbl2/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"Isolabel2".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new Isolabel project, and additions to two of the xp_comm_lib/ files (in this
instance mappers.v and examples.v) to add links to the User Macro and
Example Applications from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists,
and has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the project, and elect to specify the process as "user" or
another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without
having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the
VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.Isolabel2.Isolabel2Mods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant 
Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.



Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/isolabel/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v,
               xp_comm_lib/mappers and xp_comm_lib/examples.v files. This file should
               not be edited as the future installation script will use
               this file.

isolbl2.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.Isolabel2 library.

isl2mods.v     Creates the Isolabel2Mods library containing the low-level module
               Isolabel2Core and the parameter block Isolabel2Param.

isl2macs.v     Creates the library containing the Functional macro Isolabel2Func,
               the UI macro Isolabel2UI, the User macro isolabel2 and the example
               applications Isolabel2Eg1 and Isolabel2Eg2.

isolbl2.cxx    The C++ source code for the low-level module.

doc_mod.html   HTML documentation for the low-level module

doc_umac.html  HTML documentation for the User Macros.

README         This file.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx              AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx              AVS/Express generated source code.

isolbl2.o/obj        Intermediate object file.
