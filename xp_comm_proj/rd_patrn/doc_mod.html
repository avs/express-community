<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<blockquote>
Reads the contents of an ASCII Patran Neutral File, and outputs a group 
structure containing nodes and connectivity.

<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level ReadPatranCore module takes an input file, in PATRAN neutral
file format. The reader is based on the 2.5 specification of Patran. The input 
stream is parsed, and primitive arrays and scalars are obtained and an output 
structure is populated. The output structure contains the data necessary to form 
AVS/Express mesh structures which can be used by other visualization components. 
Not all entity types present in the PATRAN neutral format are supported. 
Currently the ReadPatranCore module supports the the following entity types:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Points</li>
<li>Lines</li>
<li>Triangular Mesh</li>
<li>Quad Mesh</li>
<li>Tetrahedral Mesh</li>
<li>Approximate Patches</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Approximate patches are generated from Nurbs and Bspline patches.  Patch 
subdivision has not been implemented and hence these patches are replaced by 
flat polygons.
</blockquote>


<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>&amp;ReadPatranParams</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the parameter block, which contains real instances of the 
parameters for the ReadPatran modules and macros. The ReadPatranCore module only 
makes use of the filename parameter.  All other parameters are ignored.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b><i>filename</i></b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The name of the file that should be read from. The parameter is of type string.
The filename should specify the full path name of the file. Normally the value 
of this parameter is found by referring to the parameter block, which is
referenced by the &amp;ReadPatranParams input.
</blockquote>


<h3>Outputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<b><i>neutral_output</i></b>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
A group object containing the structure of the input PATRAN neutral file. The 
neutral_output group contains a variety of variables.  These can be separated 
into 3 categories:

<h4>Descriptive Header Text</h4>

<blockquote>
The Header of the PATRAN neutral file contains two lines of text. These are read
into the string variables title1 and title2.
</blockquote>

<h4>Node Data</h4>

<blockquote>
The vertexes contained within the PATRAN file can described by two variables. 
n_nodes specifies how many nodes the model contains and xyz[n_nodes][3] is an 
array of coordinates describing the nodes.
</blockquote>

<h4>Connectivity Data</h4>

<blockquote>
The connectivity defining the various entity types is described by a series of 
pairs of variables. In the case of the triangular mesh, n_tri specifies how many 
triangles there are in the mesh and tri_conn[n_tri*3] describes which nodes form 
each of the triangles. If a entity type is not present in the input file then 
the relevant variables are set to 0. Please note that some of the connectivity 
variables are currently unused.
</blockquote>

The node and connectivity data is used by mesh mapping modules in the ReadPatran 
functional macro to form mesh data structures that can be used by other 
visualization components.
</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Modules</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level ReadPatranCore module is used in the Functional Macro
ReadPatran.  This Functional Macro is used within the User Macro read_patran. 
The low-level ReadPatranCore module also makes use of the ReadPatranParams and 
neutral_output common parameter blocks.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
An example application ReadPatranEg is provided that reads a PATRAN file and 
renders two views of the data. The first view shows the GroupObject output and 
can be controlled through the UI. The second view shows how the out_mesh output 
can be used as the input to visualization modules. The external_edges module is 
used to reduce the size of the triangle mesh while the shrink_cells module is 
used to allow the structure of the tetrahedral mesh to be viewed. A sample 
PATRAN file, ex01.out, is provided with the distribution of this project. 
</blockquote>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>xp_comm_proj/rd_patrn/pat_mods.v</i> contains the V definitions of the 
ReadPatranCore module and the ReadPatranParams and neutral_output parameter 
blocks.
</blockquote>


<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
If required the number of data packets buffered by the ReadPatranCore module can 
be changed by editing the patran.hxx file and changing the constants at the top 
of that file. These are all start with <tt>PN_</tt>. Comments describe the 
function of each of these constants.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The low-level ReadPatranMods library containing the module ReadPatranCore does 
not specify a process. By default the express process will be used.
