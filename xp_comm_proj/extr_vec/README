Express Community ExtractVector Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/extr_vec/ ) contains all the V code, HTML
documentation, and installation information for the Community project
"ExtractVector".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new ExtractVector project, and additions to one or more of files in the
xp_comm_lib/ directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library
page.

This project contains no source code, and hence does not require compilation.
Please not however that this project uses the Developer Edition DVextr_vec
module; therefore Visualization Edition users will not be able to use this
project.
