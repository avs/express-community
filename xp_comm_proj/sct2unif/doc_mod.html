<h3>Description</h3>

<blockquote>
The sct2unif module converts a structured field with a number of
scattered nodes into a uniform field. The resultant uniform field can
then be visualised using simple techniques, such as orthoslice. This generation
is done by creating a uniform mesh and mapping each scattered node to the
nearest node in the uniform mesh. If a uniform node has no corresponding
scattered node then all node-data components are given the value
<TT>fill_value</TT>. If multiple scattered nodes map to a single uniform
node then the resultant node-data values are the average of the
scattered node-data values.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The uniform mesh used to generate the output field has nodes spaced at
unit intervals along each at its dimensions. The mesh has as many
computational dimensions (<TT>ndim</TT>) as the input field has
coordinate dimensions (<TT>nspace</TT>) and the same number of
coordinate dimensions as the input field. Each coordinate dimension of
the output field extends from the (minimum value -1) to the (maximum
value +1) of that dimension in the input field.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The sct2unif module performs a similar function to that of the standard
AVS scat_to_unif macro. The scat_to_unif macro also performs
interpolation between the nodes in the resultant uniform field.
Therefore the sct2unif module is significantly less complex and hence
will be of most use in situations where only a simple conversion is
required. In some situations interpolation between nodes reduces the
clarity of the visualisation and is not desirable. Therefore this module
can also be used in those situations to provide better results.
</blockquote>


<h3>Inputs</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>&amp;in_fld</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to the structured field that contains the scattered nodes
that are to be converted into a uniform field.  The structered field must
have a 1 dimensional array of nodes (<TT>ndim=1</TT>).  If this is not the
case then the module will stop with an error.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><b>&amp;fill_value</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Reference to a primitive value that specifies which value should be used to fill
in blank nodes.  If no scattered node maps to a node in the uniform field then 
the node-data components for that node will be set equal to this value.
</blockquote>


<h3>Output</h3>

<blockquote>
<i><b>out</b></i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The generated uniform field. The uniform field has dimensions that are a
unit larger in all dimensions than the extents of the scattered nodes.
The field also has the same number of node-data components as the
scattered nodes.
</blockquote>


<h3>Utility Macros</h3>

<blockquote>
The macro field2scat takes Field objects, removes any connectivity
information present and rearranges the resultant data into a format that
can be used by the sct2unif module. The primary application of this
macro is to allow UCD data to be mapped to a uniform mesh using
the sct2unif module.  This is demonstrated in the example application Sct2UnifEg3.
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
Three example applications are provided; Sct2UnifEg1, Sct2UnifEg2,
Sct2UnifEg3. Please note that an object of one color in the "Before"
view does not neccessarily correspond to the same color object in the
"After" view. This is because the fill_value used changes the range of
data values, and hence changes the way values are mapped to colours.

<ul>
	<li>Sct2UnifEg1: Demonstrates mapping of 3D scattered data to a 3D uniform mesh. Also demonstrates mapping of multiple node-data components.</li>
	<li>Sct2UnifEg2: Demonstrates mapping of 2D scattered data to a 2D uniform mesh. Also demonstrates how nodes are mapped to the nearest uniform node.</li>
	<li>Sct2UnifEg3: Demonstrates a situation were interpolation by scat_to_unif macro obscures the data being visualised.</li>

<h3>Files</h3>

<blockquote>
<I>xp_comm_proj/sct2unif/s2ufmods.v</I> contains the sct2unif module
and the field2scat utility macro V definitions.

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>
The low-level Sct2UnifMods library containing the module
sct2unif does not specify a process. By default the express
process will be used.
