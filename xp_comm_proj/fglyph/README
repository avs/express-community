Express Community FastGlyph project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
---------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/fglyph/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community project "FastGlyph".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new FastGlyph project, and additions to two of the files in the xp_comm_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already exists, and
has been updated accordingly.

If you modify the FastGlyph project, and elect to specify the process as "user"
or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled without having
to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command in the VCP to
compile the module:

	$compile XP_COMM_PROJ.FastGlyph.FastGlyphMods

Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the relevant Templates
library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.


Files
-----

The following files can be found in the xp_comm_proj/fglyph/ directory.

INSTALL        Contains installation instructions for editing the xp_comm_proj.v
               and xp_comm_lib/mappers.v and xp_comm_lib/examples.v files. This file
               should not be edited as the future installation script will
               use this file.

fglyph.v       Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.FastGlyph library.

fgmods.v       Creates the FastGlyphMods library containing the low-level
               modules, FastGlyph2DCore and FastGlyph3DCore, and the parameter
               block FastGlyph2DParams.

fgmacs.v       Creates the FastGlyphMacs library containing Functional macros
               FastGlyph2D and FastGlyph3D, the UI macros FastGlyph2DUI and FastGlyph3DUI,
               the User macro fast_glyph_2d and fast_glyph_3d, and the example applications
               FastGlyph2D_AngleEg, FastGlyph2D_SizeEg, FastGlyph3D_SimpleEg
               and FastGlyph3D_SizeEg.

fglyph2d.cxx   The C++ source code for the FastGlyph2DCore module.

fglyph3d.cxx   The C++ source code for the FastGlyph3DCore module.

fglyph.html    HTML documentation for the FastGlyph project.

README         This file.



Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
completed, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.hxx	        AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx	        AVS/Express generated source code.

fglyph2d.o(bj)  Intermediate object files.
fglyph3d.o(bj)
