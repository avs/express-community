<h3>
Description</h3>

<blockquote>This module accepts a geometry mesh of triangle or quad cell
sets and outputs the object's volume and surface area.&nbsp; The input
is assumed to be a 3D connected mesh enclosing some single volume, where
the triangle or quad cells define the surface boundary of the area. This
is typical of the isosurface module or isovolume followed by external faces.
If the area does not enclose a single volume, then the volume calculations
may be incorrect, however the surface area calculation always should report
the overall surface area described by the input mesh shape. If the geometric
units defining the object are not the desired units, then a conversion
factor can be entered, for instance to convert feet to meters. The internal
volume of the shape is computed using Gauss' Theorem, rather than by explicitly
looking at all cells in the interior. The module will report an error if
anything other than linear triangle or quad cell sets are connected. The
local Mesh Xform transformation matrix is applied to all coordinates prior
to area and volume computation, so if the object is scaled this will be
reflected in the resulting computation.
<p>This module uses a form of Gauss' Theorem, or Greens' Theorem in Space.
This allows a direct computation of the volume enclosed by a single valued
continuous closed surface. All surface normals must point "outwards" for
this operation to be correct. See notes section for details. The output
of external faces may be used under special circumstances, such as for
the simple one-cell test cases. If the enclosed volume can be assumed to
contain homogeneous material of unit density, then the volume integral
will also equal the mass. This module does not attempt to integrate node
data, it only operates on the geometric mesh information.
<p>This module is a re-implementation of work described in the paper:

<h3>
Input Ports</h3>

<blockquote><b><i>in</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The input field for this module should be the direct output
from isosurface or external_faces.</blockquote>

<h3>
Output Ports</h3>

<blockquote><b><i>area, volume</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The output scalar values are the result of the area and volume
calculations on the input mesh.</blockquote>

<h3>
Example</h3>

<blockquote>An example application VolintegralEg is provided. The dataset
water.fld that comes with AVS/Express is used. The values can be seen by
float objects in the network editor. The surface mesh used to compute surface
area and volume in this example is generated from the isosurface module.</blockquote>

<h3>
Other Notes</h3>

<blockquote>This module makes some critical assumptions about the input
triangle mesh. The surface must be closed. It must not self-intersect.
All normals must point outwards. The surface must describe one connected
volume. None of the triangles or quads can be hidden inside the enclosed
volume, that is the interior must be empty. The surface is not restricted
to a convex shape. Note that the "external faces" module cannot be relied
apon to meet these conditions.&nbsp; If ANY of these assumptions are invalid,
then the resulting numerical computation will be invalid.</blockquote>
