Express Community Boundingboxes Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/bounding_boxes/ ) contains all the V code, source
code, HTML documentation, and installation information for the Community
project "Boundingboxes".

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory,
which should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the
xp_comm_proj/, xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add
the new Boundingboxes.
