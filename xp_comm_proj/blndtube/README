Express Community BlendyTubes Project
https://github.com/avs/express-community
-----------------------

This directory ( xp_comm_proj/blndtube/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the BlendyTubes project.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the Community Project File structure, i.e., the xp_comm_proj/,
xp_comm_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing Community
files: a single line addition to the xp_comm_proj/xp_comm_proj.v file, to add the
new BlendyTubes project, and two single line additions to two of the xp_comm_lib/
files (in this instance mappers.v and examples.v) to add a link to the User
Macro and the Example Application from the top-level Community library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level module of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

        base -comp_proc express -exit
or
        make -f express.mk

        Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

        If you modify the BlendyTubes project, and elect to specify
the process as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module
may be compiled without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use
the following command in the VCP to compile the module:

        $compile XP_COMM_PROJ.BlendyTubes.BlendyTubesMods

        Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

                and xp_comm_lib/ mappers.v and examples.v files. This file should
                not be edited as the future installation script will use this
                file.

blndtube.v      Creates the XP_COMM_PROJ.BlendyTubes library.

blndmods.v	Creates the BlendyTubesMods library containing the low-level
                module BlendyTubesCore and the parameter group BlendyTubesParams.
